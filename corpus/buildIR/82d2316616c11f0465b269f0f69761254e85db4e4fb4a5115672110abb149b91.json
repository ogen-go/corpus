You can do this [with the Linode API](/docs/api/account/#oauth-client-create) or [via the Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/profile/clients):\n\n      - When creating the client, you'll supply a `label` and a `redirect_uri` (referred to as the Callback URL in the Cloud Manager).\n      - The response from this endpoint will give you a `client_id` and a `secret`.\n      - Clients can be public or private, and are private by default. You can choose to make the client public when it is created.\n        - A private client is used with applications which can securely store the client secret (that is, the secret returned to you when you first created the client). For example, an application running on a secured server that only the developer has access to would use a private OAuth client. This is also called a confidential client in some OAuth documentation.\n        - A public client is used with applications where the client secret is not guaranteed to be secure. For example, a native app running on a user's computer may not be able to keep the client secret safe, as a user could potentially inspect the source of the application. So, native apps or apps that run in a user's browser should use a public client.\n        - Public and private clients follow different workflows, as described below.\n\n    #### OAuth Workflow\n\n    The OAuth workflow is a series of exchanges between your third-party app and Linode. The workflow is used\n    to authenticate a user before an application can start making API calls on the user's behalf.\n\n    Notes:\n\n    - With respect to the diagram in [section 1.2 of RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.2), login.linode.com (referred to in this section as the *login server*)\n    is the Resource Owner and the Authorization Server; api.linode.com (referred to here as the *api server*) is the Resource Server.\n    - The OAuth spec refers to the private and public workflows listed below as the [authorization code flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1) and [implicit flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.2).\n\n    | PRIVATE WORKFLOW | PUBLIC WORKFLOW |\n    |------------------|------------------|\n    | 1.  The user visits the application's website and is directed to login with Linode. | 1.  The user visits the application's website and is directed to login with Linode. |\n    | 2.  Your application then redirects the user to Linode's [login server](https://login.linode.com) with the client application's `client_id` and requested OAuth `scope`, which should appear in the URL of the login page. | 2.  Your application then redirects the user to Linode's [login server](https://login.linode.com) with the client application's `client_id` and requested OAuth `scope`, which should appear in the URL of the login page. |\n    | 3.  The user logs into the login server with their username and password. | 3.  The user logs into the login server with their username and password. |\n    | 4.  The login server redirects the user to the specificed redirect URL with a temporary authorization `code` (exchange code) in the URL. | 4.  The login server redirects the user back to your application with an OAuth `access_token` embedded in the redirect URL's hash. This is temporary and expires in two hours. No `refresh_token` is issued. Therefore, once the `access_token` expires, a new one will need to be issued by having the user log in again. |\n    | 5.  The application issues a POST request (*see below*) to the login server with the exchange code, `client_id`, and the client application's `client_secret`. | |\n    | 6.  The login server responds to the client application with a new OAuth `access_token` and `refresh_token`. The `access_token` is set to expire in two hours. | |\n    | 7.  The `refresh_token` can be used by contacting the login server with the `client_id`, `client_secret`, `grant_type`, and `refresh_token` to get a new OAuth `access_token` and `refresh_token`. The new `access_token` is good for another two hours, and the new `refresh_token`, can be used to extend the session again by this same method. | |\n\n    #### OAuth Private Workflow - Additional Details\n\n    The following information expands on steps 5 through 7 of the private workflow:\n\n    Once the user has logged into Linode and you have received an exchange code,\n    you will need to trade that exchange code for an `access_token` and `refresh_token`. You\n    do this by making an HTTP POST request to the following address:\n\n    ```\n    https://login.linode.com/oauth/token\n    ```\n\n    Make this request as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or as\n    `multipart/form-data` and include the following parameters in the POST body:\n\n    | PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION |\n    |-----------|-------------|\n    | grant_type | The grant type you're using for renewal.  Currently only the string \"refresh_token\" is accepted. |\n    | client_id | Your app's client ID. |\n    | client_secret | Your app's client secret. |\n    | code | The code you just received from the redirect. |\n\n    You'll get a response like this:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"scope\": \"linodes:read_write\",\n      \"access_token\": \"03d084436a6c91fbafd5c4b20c82e5056a2e9ce1635920c30dc8d81dc7a6665c\"\n      \"token_type\": \"bearer\",\n      \"expires_in\": 7200,\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Included in the reponse is an `access_token`. With this token, you can proceed to make\n    authenticated HTTP requests to the API by adding this header to each request:\n\n    ```\n    Authorization: Bearer 03d084436a6c91fbafd5c4b20c82e5056a2e9ce1635920c30dc8d81dc7a6665c\n    ```\n\n    #### OAuth Reference\n\n    | Security Scheme Type | OAuth 2.0 |\n    |-----------------------|--------|\n    | **Authorization URL** | https://login.linode.com/oauth/authorize |\n    | **Token URL** | https://login.linode.com/oauth/token |\n    | **Scopes** | \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e`account:read_only` - Allows access to GET information about your Account.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`account:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your Account.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`domains:read_only` - Allows access to GET Domains on your Account.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`domains:read_write` - Allows access to all Domain endpoints.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`events:read_only` - Allows access to GET your Events.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`events:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your Events.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`firewall:read_only` - Allows access to GET information about your Firewalls.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`firewall:read_write` - Allows access to all Firewall endpoints.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`images:read_only` - Allows access to GET your Images.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`images:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your Images.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`ips:read_only` - Allows access to GET your ips.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`ips:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your ips.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`linodes:read_only` - Allows access to GET Linodes on your Account.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`linodes:read_write` - Allow access to all endpoints related to your Linodes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`lke:read_only` - Allows access to GET LKE Clusters on your Account.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`lke:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to LKE Clusters on your Account.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`longview:read_only` - Allows access to GET your Longview Clients.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`longview:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your Longview Clients.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`maintenance:read_only` - Allows access to GET information about Maintenance on your account.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`nodebalancers:read_only` - Allows access to GET NodeBalancers on your Account.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`nodebalancers:read_write` - Allows access to all NodeBalancer endpoints.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`object_storage:read_only` - Allows access to GET information related to your Object Storage.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`object_storage:read_write` - Allows access to all Object Storage endpoints.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`stackscripts:read_only` - Allows access to GET your StackScripts.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`stackscripts:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your StackScripts.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`volumes:read_only` - Allows access to GET your Volumes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e`volumes:read_write` - Allows access to all endpoints related to your Volumes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e|\n\n    ## Requests\n\n    Requests must be made over HTTPS to ensure transactions are encrypted. The\n    following Request methods are supported:\n\n    | METHOD | USAGE |\n    |--------|-------|\n    | GET    | Retrieves data about collections and individual resources. |\n    | POST   | For collections, creates a new resource of that type. Also used to perform actions on action endpoints. |\n    | PUT    | Updates an existing resource. |\n    | DELETE | Deletes a resource. This is a destructive action. |\n\n\n    ## Responses\n\n    Actions will return one following HTTP response status codes:\n\n    | STATUS  | DESCRIPTION |\n    |---------|-------------|\n    | 200 OK  | The request was successful. |\n    | 204 No Content | The server successfully fulfilled the request and there is no additional content to send. |\n    | 400 Bad Request | You submitted an invalid request (missing parameters, etc.). |\n    | 401 Unauthorized | You failed to authenticate for this resource. |\n    | 403 Forbidden | You are authenticated, but don't have permission to do this. |\n    | 404 Not Found | The resource you're requesting does not exist. |\n    | 429 Too Many Requests | You've hit a rate limit. |\n    | 500 Internal Server Error | Please [open a Support Ticket](/docs/api/support/#support-ticket-open). |\n\n    ## Errors\n\n    Success is indicated via \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes\" target=\"_top\"\u003eStandard HTTP status codes\u003c/a\u003e.\n    `2xx` codes indicate success, `4xx` codes indicate a request error, and\n    `5xx` errors indicate a server error. A\n    request error might be an invalid input, a required parameter being omitted,\n    or a malformed request. A server error means something went wrong processing\n    your request. If this occurs, please\n    [open a Support Ticket](/docs/api/support/#support-ticket-open)\n    and let us know. Though errors are logged and we work quickly to resolve issues,\n    opening a ticket and providing us with reproducable steps and data is always helpful.\n\n    The `errors` field is an array of the things that went wrong with your request.\n    We will try to include as many of the problems in the response as possible,\n    but it's conceivable that fixing these errors and resubmitting may result in\n    new errors coming back once we are able to get further along in the process\n    of handling your request.\n\n\n    Within each error object, the `field` parameter will be included if the error\n    pertains to a specific field in the JSON you've submitted. This will be\n    omitted if there is no relevant field. The `reason` is a human-readable\n    explanation of the error, and will always be included.\n\n    ## Pagination\n\n    Resource lists are always paginated. The response will look similar to this:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"data\": [ ... ],\n        \"page\": 1,\n        \"pages\": 3,\n        \"results\": 300\n    }\n    ```\n\n    * Pages start at 1. You may retrieve a specific page of results by adding\n    `?page=x` to your URL (for example, `?page=4`). If the value of `page`\n    exceeds `2^64/page_size`, the last possible page will be returned.\n\n\n    * Page sizes default to 100,\n    and can be set to return between 25 and 500. Page size can be set using\n    `?page_size=x`.\n\n    ## Filtering and Sorting\n\n    Collections are searchable by fields they include, marked in the spec as\n    `x-linode-filterable: true`. Filters are passed\n    in the `X-Filter` header and are formatted as JSON objects. Here is a request\n    call for Linode Types in our \"standard\" class:\n\n    ```Shell\n    curl \"https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types\" \\\n      -H '\n        X-Filter: {\n          \"class\": \"standard\"\n        }'\n    ```\n\n    The filter object's keys are the keys of the object you're filtering,\n    and the values are accepted values. You can add multiple filters by\n    including more than one key. For example, filtering for \"standard\" Linode\n    Types that offer one vcpu:\n\n    ```Shell\n     curl \"https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types\" \\\n      -H '\n        X-Filter: {\n          \"class\": \"standard\",\n          \"vcpus\": 1\n        }'\n    ```\n\n    In the above example, both filters are combined with an \"and\" operation.\n    However, if you wanted either Types with one vcpu or Types in our \"standard\"\n    class, you can add an operator:\n\n     ```Shell\n    curl \"https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types\" \\\n      -H '\n        X-Filter: {\n          \"+or\": [\n            { \"vcpus\": 1 },\n            { \"class\": \"standard\" }\n          ]\n        }'\n    ```\n\n    Each filter in the `+or` array is its own filter object, and all conditions\n    in it are combined with an \"and\" operation as they were in the previous example.\n\n    Other operators are also available. Operators are keys of a Filter JSON\n    object. Their value must be of the appropriate type, and they are evaluated\n    as described below:\n\n    | OPERATOR | TYPE   | DESCRIPTION                       |\n    |----------|--------|-----------------------------------|\n    | +and     | array  | All conditions must be true.       |\n    | +or      | array  | One condition must be true.        |\n    | +gt      | number | Value must be greater than number. |\n    | +gte     | number | Value must be greater than or equal to number. |\n    | +lt      | number | Value must be less than number. |\n    | +lte     | number | Value must be less than or equal to number. |\n    | +contains | string | Given string must be in the value. |\n    | +neq      | string | Does not equal the value.          |\n    | +order_by | string | Attribute to order the results by - must be filterable. |\n    | +order    | string | Either \"asc\" or \"desc\". Defaults to \"asc\". Requires `+order_by`. |\n\n    For example, filtering for [Linode Types](/docs/api/linode-types/)\n    that offer memory equal to or higher than 61440:\n\n    ```Shell\n    curl \"https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types\" \\\n      -H '\n        X-Filter: {\n          \"memory\": {\n            \"+gte\": 61440\n          }\n        }'\n    ```\n\n    You can combine and nest operators to construct arbitrarily-complex queries.\n    For example, give me all [Linode Types](/docs/api/linode-types/)\n    which are either `standard` or `highmem` class, or\n    have between 12 and 20 vcpus:\n\n    ```Shell\n    curl \"https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types\" \\\n      -H '\n        X-Filter: {\n          \"+or\": [\n            {\n              \"+or\": [\n                {\n                  \"class\": \"standard\"\n                },\n                {\n                  \"class\": \"highmem\"\n                }\n              ]\n            },\n            {\n              \"+and\": [\n                {\n                  \"vcpus\": {\n                    \"+gte\": 12\n                  }\n                },\n                {\n                  \"vcpus\": {\n                    \"+lte\": 20\n                  }\n                }\n              ]\n            }\n          ]\n        }'\n    ```\n\n    ## Rate Limiting\n\n    With the Linode API, you can make up to 1,600 general API requests every two minutes per user as\n    determined by IP adddress or by OAuth token. Additionally, there are endpoint specfic limits defined below.\n\n    **Note:** There may be rate limiting applied at other levels outside of the API, for example, at the load balancer.\n\n    `/stats` endpoints have their own dedicated limits of 100 requests per minute per user.\n    These endpoints are:\n\n    * [View Linode Statistics](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-statistics-view)\n    * [View Linode Statistics (year/month)](/docs/api/linode-instances/#statistics-yearmonth-view)\n    * [View NodeBalancer Statistics](/docs/api/nodebalancers/#nodebalancer-statistics-view)\n    * [List Managed Stats](/docs/api/managed/#managed-stats-list)\n\n    Object Storage endpoints have a dedicated limit of 750 requests per second per user.\n    The Object Storage endpoints are:\n\n    * [Object Storage Endpoints](/docs/api/object-storage/)\n\n    Opening Support Tickets has a dedicated limit of 2 requests per minute per user.\n    That endpoint is:\n\n    * [Open Support Ticket](/docs/api/support/#support-ticket-open)\n\n    Accepting Service Transfers has a dedicated limit of 2 requests per minute per user.\n    That endpoint is:\n\n    * [Service Transfer Accept](/docs/api/account/#service-transfer-accept)\n\n    ## CLI (Command Line Interface)\n\n    The \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/linode/linode-cli\" target=\"_top\"\u003eLinode CLI\u003c/a\u003e allows you to easily\n    work with the API using intuitive and simple syntax.

For more information,\n        see [Sending Email on Linode](/docs/email/running-a-mail-server/#sending-email-on-linode).\n\n        Linodes can be created in a number of ways:\n\n        * Using a Linode Linux Distribution image or an Image you created based on another Linode.\n          * The Linode will be `running` after it completes `provisioning`.\n          * A default config with two Disks, one being a 512 swap disk, is created.\n            * `swap_size` can be used to customize the swap disk size.\n          * Requires a `root_pass` be supplied to use for the root User's Account.\n          * It is recommended to supply SSH keys for the root User using the `authorized_keys` field.\n          * You may also supply a list of usernames via the `authorized_users` field.\n            * These users must have an SSH Key associated with your Profile first. See [/profile/sshkeys](/docs/api/profile/#ssh-key-add) for more information.\n\n        * Using a StackScript.\n          * See [/linode/stackscripts](/docs/api/stackscripts/#stackscripts-list) for\n            a list of available StackScripts.\n          * The Linode will be `running` after it completes `provisioning`.\n          * Requires a compatible Image to be supplied.\n            * See [/linode/stackscript/{stackscriptId}](/docs/api/stackscripts/#stackscript-view) for compatible Images.\n          * Requires a `root_pass` be supplied to use for the root User's Account.\n          * It is recommended to supply SSH keys for the root User using the `authorized_keys` field.\n          * You may also supply a list of usernames via the `authorized_users` field.\n            * These users must have an SSH Key associated with your Profile first.

VLANs provide\n        a mechanism for secure communication between two or more Linodes that are assigned to the\n        same VLAN and are both within the same Layer 2 broadcast domain.\n\n        VLANs are created and attached to Linodes by using the `interfaces` property for the following endpoints:\n\n        - Linode Create ([POST /linode/instances](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-create))\n        - Configuration Profile Create ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/configs](/docs/api/linode-instances/#configuration-profile-create))\n        - Configuration Profile Update ([PUT /linode/instances/{linodeId}/configs/{configId}](/docs/api/linode-instances/#configuration-profile-update))\n\n        There are several ways to detach a VLAN from a Linode:\n\n        - [Update](/docs/api/linode-instances/#configuration-profile-update) the active Configuration Profile to remove the VLAN interface, then [reboot](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-reboot) the Linode.\n        - [Create](/docs/api/linode-instances/#configuration-profile-create) a new Configuration Profile without the VLAN interface, then [reboot](/docs/apilinode-instances/#linode-reboot) the Linode into the new Configuration Profile.\n        - [Delete](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-delete) the Linode.\n\n        **VLANs cannot be manually renamed.** If a VLAN's label must be changed, create a new VLAN and attach all required Linodes to it.\n\n        **VLANs cannot be manually deleted.** There is no need to manually delete a VLAN. If a VLAN is no longer needed, detach it from all Linodes. A VLANs that are not attached to any Linodes are automatically deleted within a short timeframe.\n\n        **Note:** Only Next Generation Network (NGN) data centers support VLANs. Use the Regions ([/regions](/docs/api/regions/)) endpoint to view the capabilities of data center regions.\n        If a VLAN is attached to your Linode and you attempt to migrate or clone it to a non-NGN data center,\n        the migration or cloning will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be migrated because of an incompatibility,\n        you will be prompted to select a different data center or contact support.\n      operationId: getVLANs\n      parameters:\n        - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/pageOffset\"\n        - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/pageSize\"\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                properties:\n                  data:\n                    items:\n                      $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Vlans\"\n                    type: array\n                  page:\n                    $ref: \"#/components/schemas/PaginationEnvelope/properties/page\"\n                  pages:\n                    $ref: \"#/components/schemas/PaginationEnvelope/properties/pages\"\n                  results:\n                    $ref: \"#/components/schemas/PaginationEnvelope/properties/results\"\n                type: object\n          description: The VLANs available on this Account.\n        default:\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/ErrorResponse\"\n      security:\n        - personalAccessToken: []\n        - oauth:\n            - linodes:read_only\n      servers:\n        - url: https://api.linode.com/v4\n        - url: https://api.linode.com/v4beta\n      summary: VLANs List\n      tags:\n        - Networking\n      x-code-samples:\n        - lang: Shell\n          source: |\n            curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\\n                https://api.linode.com/v4/networking/vlans/\n        - lang: CLI\n          source: |\n            linode-cli networking vlans-list\n      x-linode-cli-action: list\n      x-linode-grant: read_only\n    x-linode-cli-command: vlans\n  /nodebalancers:\n    get:\n      description: |\n        Returns a paginated list of NodeBalancers you have access to.\n      operationId: getNodeBalancers\n      parameters:\n        - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/pageOffset\"\n        - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/pageSize\"\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                properties:\n                  data:\n                    items:\n                      $ref: \"#/components/schemas/NodeBalancer\"\n                    type: array\n                  page:\n                    $ref: \"#/components/schemas/PaginationEnvelope/properties/page\"\n                  pages:\n                    $ref: \"#/components/schemas/PaginationEnvelope/properties/pages\"\n                  results:\n                    $ref: \"#/components/schemas/PaginationEnvelope/properties/results\"\n                type: object\n          description: A paginated list of NodeBalancers.\n        default:\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/ErrorResponse\"\n      security:\n        - personalAccessToken: []\n        - oauth:\n            - nodebalancers:read_only\n      summary: NodeBalancers List\n      tags:\n        - NodeBalancers\n      x-code-samples:\n        - lang: Shell\n          source: |\n            curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\\n                https://api.linode.com/v4/nodebalancers\n        - lang: CLI\n          source: |\n            linode-cli nodebalancers list\n      x-linode-cli-action: list\n      x-linode-grant: read_only\n    post:\n      description: |\n        Creates a NodeBalancer in the requested Region.

Use the Regions ([/regions](/docs/api/regions/)) endpoint to view the capabilities of data center regions.\n        If a VLAN is attached to your Linode and you attempt to migrate or clone it to a non-NGN data center,\n        the migration or cloning will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be migrated because of an incompatibility,\n        you will be prompted to select a different data center or contact support.\n      items:\n        $ref: \"#/components/schemas/LinodeConfigInterface\"\n      type: array\n    LinodeRequest:\n      description: Common properties for creating and rebuilding Linodes.\n      properties:\n        authorized_keys:\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/DiskRequest/properties/authorized_keys\"\n        authorized_users:\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/DiskRequest/properties/authorized_users\"\n        booted:\n          description: |\n            This field defaults to `true` if the Linode is created with an Image or from a Backup.\n            If it is deployed from an Image or a Backup and you wish it to remain `offline` after deployment, set this to `false`.\n          type: boolean\n          writeOnly: true\n        image:\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/DiskRequest/properties/image\"\n        root_pass:\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/DiskRequest/properties/root_pass\"\n        stackscript_data:\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/DiskRequest/properties/stackscript_data\"\n        stackscript_id:\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/DiskRequest/properties/stackscript_id\"\n      type: object\n    LinodeStats:\n      description: |\n        CPU, IO, IPv4, and IPv6 statistics.
