These criteria correspond to specific fields in the response payload. Multiple filter criteria combine to further restrict the results. The available criteria are as follows: creationDate The time period during which qualifying change requests were created (the changeRequests.creationDate field). In the URI, this is expressed as a starting timestamp, with or without an ending timestamp (in brackets). The timestamps are in ISO 8601 format, which uses the 24-hour Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) clock. For example: creationDate:[2016-02-21T08:25:43.511Z..] identifies orders created on or after the given timestamp. creationDate:[2016-02-21T08:25:43.511Z..2016-04-21T08:25:43.511Z] identifies orders created between the given timestamps, inclusive. changeRequestStatus The degree to which qualifying change requests have been resolved (the changeRequests.changeRequestStatus field). For example: changeRequestStatus:{SUBMITTED} specifies change requests that have been submitted and are being processed. changeRequestStatus:{UNDER_REVIEW|APPROVED_WITH_MODIFICATIONS} specifies change requests that are being reviewed by eBay, and change requests that have been approved, but eBay has made some modifications such as correcting typographic errors. changeRequestStatus:{REJECTED} specifies change requests that have been rejected by eBay because of a violation. referenceId The identifier of an object of the type specified by the value of the referenceType parameter. For example, if the value of referenceType is INVENTORY_ITEM, this field should contain the seller's SKU for an inventory item. If you include this without the referenceType parameter, the filter will apply to objects of any reference type with this reference ID, if specified in the change request. This parameter can take multiple values. For example: referenceId:{234242|675756} referenceType The type of object that a requested catalog change is intended to support, if specified in the change request (the changeRequests.referenceType field). For example: referenceType:{INVENTORY_ITEM} indicates that the requested change will support the completion of an inventory item, which you can then use to create an offer. referenceType:{LISTING} indicates that the requested change will support the modification of an active product listing. referenceType:{LISTING_DRAFT} indicates that the requested change will support the completion of an offer, which you can then publish as a product listing.

The seller can use the summaries to select the product in the eBay catalog that corresponds to the item that the seller wants to offer for sale. When a corresponding product is found and adopted by the seller, eBay will use the product information to populate the item listing. The criteria supported by search include keywords, product categories, and category aspects. To see the full details of a selected product, use the getProduct call. In addition to product summaries, this call can also be used to identify refinements, which help you to better pinpoint the product you're looking for. A refinement consists of one or more aspect values and a count of the number of times that each value has been used in previous eBay listings. An aspect is a property (e.g. color or size) of an eBay category, used by sellers to provide details about the items they're listing. The refinement container is returned when you include the fieldGroups query parameter in the request with a value of ASPECT_REFINEMENTS or FULL. Example A seller wants to find a product that is \u0026quot;gray\u0026quot; in color, but doesn't know what term the manufacturer uses for that color. It might be Silver, Brushed Nickel, Pewter, or even Grey. The returned refinement container identifies all aspects that have been used in past listings for products that match your search criteria, along with all of the values those aspects have taken, and the number of times each value was used. You can use this data to present the seller with a histogram of the values of each aspect. The seller can see which color values have been used in the past, and how frequently they have been used, and selects the most likely value or values for their product. You issue the search call again with those values in the aspect_filter parameter to narrow down the collection of products returned by the call. Although all query parameters are optional, this call must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value. If you provide more than one of these parameters, they will be combined with a logical AND to further refine the returned collection of matching products. Note: This call requires that certain special characters in the query parameters be percent-encoded: \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;(space) = %20 \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;, = %2C \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;: = %3A \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;[ = %5B \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;] = %5D \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;{ = %7B \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;| = %7C \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;} = %7D This requirement applies to all query parameter values. However, for readability, call examples and samples in this documentation will not use the encoding. This call returns product summaries rather than the full details of the products.

Aspects are product attributes that can represent different types of information for different products. Every product has aspects, but different products have different sets of aspects. You can determine appropriate values for the aspects by first submitting this call without this parameter. It will return either the productSummaries.aspects container, the refinement.aspectDistributions container, or both, depending on the value of the fieldgroups parameter in the request. The productSummaries.aspects container provides the category aspects and their values that are associated with each returned product. The refinement.aspectDistributions container provides information about the distribution of values of the set of category aspects associated with the specified categories. In both cases sellers can select from among the returned aspects to use with this parameter. Note: You can also use the Taxonomy API's getItemAspectsForCategory call to retrieve detailed information about aspects and their values that are appropriate for your selected category. The syntax for the aspect_filter parameter is as follows (on several lines for readability; categoryId is required): aspect_filter=categoryId:category_id, aspect1:{valueA|valueB|...}, aspect2:{valueC|valueD|...},... A matching product must be within the specified category, and it must have least one of the values identified for every specified aspect. Note: Aspect names and values are case sensitive.
