If you only want to view item condition metadata for one eBay category or a select group of eBay categories, you can pass in up to 50 eBay category ID through the filter query parameter. Important!: Certified Refurbished-eligible sellers must use an OAuth token created with the authorization code grant flow and https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.inventory scope in order to retrieve the 'Certified Refurbished' condition (condition ID 2000) for the relevant categories. The Certified Refurbished item condition will not be returned if an OAuth token created with the client credentials grant flow and https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope scope is used, or if any seller is not eligible to list with that item condition. See the Specifying OAuth scopes topic for more information about specifying scopes. Tip: If you retrieve metadata on all eBay categories for a marketplace, the response payload can be quite large. For this reason, we suggest that you consider using the Accept-Encoding request header and set its value to application/gzip.
