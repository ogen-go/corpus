This API specification should be used in conjunction with the [BaRS implementation guide](https://simplifier.net/guide/nhsbookingandreferralstandard/Home/Design/Design--Applications?version=current) for your use case.    \n    Use this API to send booking and referral information between NHS service providers.\n\n    You can:\n      * get a specific booking\n      * get bookings for a patient\n      * process a message\n      * get message definition\n      * get capability statement\n      * get a specific referral\n      * get referral/s for a patient\n      * get slots\n\n    The following describes the end-to-end process:\n    1. Send a request from your sender application to this API, along with a service identifier header.\n    2. This API redirects the request to the service associated with the service identifier header.\n    3. The target backend handles the request and sends a response back to this API.\n    4. This API returns the response to your sender application.\n\n    ## Who can use this API\n    This API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so.

We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.\n\n    This API uses our online digital onboarding process.\n\n    As part of this process, you need to demonstrate that you can manage risks and that your software conforms technically with the requirements for this API.\n\n    Information on this page might impact the design of your software. For details, see [Onboarding support information](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/booking-and-referral-fhir/onboarding-support-information).\n\n    To get started, see [digital onboarding](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/digital-onboarding).\n    \n    Details on the onboarding process can be found in our [Core Design Guidance](https://simplifier.net/guide/nhsbookingandreferralstandard/Home/Design/Design--Core?version=current#Security-and-authorisation).\n    \n    ## Errors\n    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:\n\n    * 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action\n    * 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application\n    * 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server\n    \n    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response.

If the receiver does not support BaRS functionality the BaRS API will provide an error response indicating this and the sender pursues an alternative workflow. \n\n        A receiver can only implement a subset of the functionality within the standard and the capability statement will make this clear to a sender. \n\n        What is returned is a server level response to indicate what functionality the target API supports and how to interact with it.\n      operationId: getMeta\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Success\n          content:\n            application/fhir+json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Capability'\n              example:\n                $ref: examples/metadata/GET-success.json\n            application/fhir+xml:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Capability'\n          headers:\n            X-Correlation-Id:\n              description: 'The X-Correlation-Id from the request header, if supplied, mirrored back.'\n              schema:\n                type: string\n                format: uuid\n                example: 9562466f-c982-4bd5-bb0e-255e9f5e6689\n            X-Request-Id:\n              description: 'The X-Request-Id from the request header, if supplied, mirrored back.'\n              schema:\n                type: string\n                format: uuid\n                example: c1ab3fba-6bae-4ba4-b257-5a87c44d4a91\n        4XX:\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/4XX-BARS'\n        5XX:\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/5XX-BARS'\n  /MessageDefinition:\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/RequestId_HParam'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/CorrelationId_HParam'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/TargetIdentifier_HParam'\n    get:\n      tags:\n        - Metadata\n      summary: Get Message Definition\n      description: |\n        \n        ### Returns MessageDefinitions supported by the target endpoint.\n\n        The Message Definition retrieval is required to inform a Sender on building the payload. A request is made using the Service Identifier and workflow type values, linking to the useContext and event elements, respectively, in the Message Definition resource, returning a list of FHIR resources. \n        \n        The order of workflow beyond this point is relatively flexible, the only stipulation being responses occurring after requests.\n\n        ### Sender\n        \n        The request for Message Definition is the next step for a Sender following the metadata acquisition. \n        The sender must request the Message Definition for the Service Identifier obtained previously, along with the type of workflow type e.g. booking-request, servicerequest-request. The Message Definition will contain a list of FHIR resources which the sender must include when making a booking or referral. \n        \n        ### Receiver\n\n        A receiver dictates what they need from a sender making a request and the MessageDefinition is the mechanism to support this. The Message Definition details what FHIR resources need to be included in the body (payload).\n        The receiver may support multiple services e.g. Out-of-Hours, Clinical Assessment Service under one organisation (on the same system) and consideration should be given to maintaining service identifiers and workflow type against Message Definitions.  It's advisable to make this a configurable option which providers can maintain themselves as new services come onboard.\n      operationId: getMessageDefinition\n      parameters:\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/context_QParam'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Success\n          content:\n            application/fhir+json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/MessageDefinition'\n              example:\n                $ref: examples/message_definition/MessageDefinition_ServiceRequest-request_CaseTransfer.json\n            application/fhir+xml:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/MessageDefinition'\n          headers:\n            X-Correlation-Id:\n              description: 'The X-Correlation-Id from the request header, if supplied, mirrored back.'\n              schema:\n                type: string\n                format: uuid\n                example: 9562466f-c982-4bd5-bb0e-255e9f5e6689\n            X-Request-Id:\n              description: 'The X-Request-Id from the request header, if supplied, mirrored back.'\n              schema:\n                type: string\n                format: uuid\n                example: c1ab3fba-6bae-4ba4-b257-5a87c44d4a91\n        4XX:\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/4XX-BARS'\n        5XX:\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/5XX-BARS'\n  /$process-message:\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/TargetIdentifier_HParam'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/RequestId_HParam'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/CorrelationId_HParam'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/RequestingOrganisation_HParam'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/RequestingPractitioner_HParam'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/RequestingDevice_HParam'\n    post:\n      tags:\n        - Message\n      summary: Process a message\n      description: |\n        \n        ### Using $process-message\n        The inherent flexibility of the various workflows supported by BaRS is facilitated by the $process-message endpoint.
