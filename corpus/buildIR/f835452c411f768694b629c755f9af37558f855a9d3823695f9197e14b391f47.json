For transaction history from investments accounts, use the [Investments endpoint](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products#investments) instead. Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.\n\n        Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).\n\n        Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.\n\n        Data returned by `/transactions/get` will be the data available for the Item as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. An Item's `status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.\n\n        Note that data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to `/transactions/get`, if it wasn't. To be alerted when transaction data is ready to be fetched, listen for the [`INITIAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks#transactions-initial_update) and [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks#transactions-historical_update) webhooks. If no transaction history is ready when `/transactions/get` is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.\n      requestBody:\n        description: Request payload\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/TransactionsGetRequest'\n            examples: {}\n  /transactions/refresh:\n    post:\n      tags:\n      - plaid\n      summary: Refresh transaction data\n      externalDocs:\n        url: /api/products/#transactionsrefresh\n      operationId: transactionsRefresh\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: OK\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/TransactionsRefreshResponse'\n              examples:\n                example-1:\n                  value:\n                    request_id: 1vwmF5TBQwiqfwP\n        default:\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Error'\n          description: Error response\n      description: |-\n        `/transactions/refresh` is an optional endpoint for users of the Transactions product. It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for an Item. This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur multiple times a day for any Transactions-enabled Item. If changes to transactions are discovered after calling `/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks#deleted-transactions-detected) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks#transactions-default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling `/transactions/get`.\n\n        Access to `/transactions/refresh` in Production is specific to certain pricing plans. If you cannot access `/transactions/refresh` in Production, [contact Sales](https://www.plaid.com/contact) for assistance.\n      requestBody:\n        description: Request payload\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/TransactionsRefreshRequest'\n  /institutions/get:\n    post:\n      tags:\n      - plaid\n      summary: Get details of all supported institutions\n      externalDocs:\n        url: /api/institutions/#institutionsget\n      operationId: institutionsGet\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: OK\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/InstitutionsGetResponse'\n              examples:\n                example-1:\n                  value:\n                    institutions:\n                    - country_codes:\n                      - US\n                      institution_id: ins_1\n                      name: Bank of America\n                      oauth: false\n                      products:\n                      - assets\n                      - auth\n                      - balance\n                      - transactions\n                      - identity\n                      - liabilities\n                      routing_numbers:\n                      - \"011000138\"\n                      - \"011200365\"\n                      - \"011400495\"\n                      - \"011500010\"\n                      - \"011900254\"\n                      - \"021000322\"\n                      - \"021200339\"\n                      - \"026009593\"\n                      - \"031202084\"\n                      - \"051000017\"\n                      - \"052001633\"\n                      - \"053000196\"\n                      - \"053904483\"\n                      - \"054001204\"\n                      - \"061000052\"\n                      - \"063100277\"\n                      - \"064000020\"\n                      - \"071214579\"\n                      - \"072000805\"\n                      - \"073000176\"\n                      - \"081000032\"\n                      - \"081904808\"\n                      - \"082000073\"\n                      - \"101100045\"\n                      - \"103000017\"\n                      - \"107000327\"\n                      - \"111000025\"\n                      - \"121000358\"\n                      - \"122101706\"\n                      - \"122400724\"\n                      - \"123103716\"\n                      - \"125000024\"\n                      - \"323070380\"\n                    request_id: tbFyCEqkU774ZGG\n                    total: 11384\n        default:\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Error'\n          description: Error response\n      description: |-\n        Returns a JSON response containing details on all financial institutions currently supported by Plaid.

As a result, balances returned may not be up-to-date; for realtime balance information, use `/accounts/balance/get` instead.\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: success\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/AccountsGetResponse'\n              examples:\n                example-1:\n                  value:\n                    accounts:\n                    - account_id: blgvvBlXw3cq5GMPwqB6s6q4dLKB9WcVqGDGo\n                      balances:\n                        available: 100\n                        current: 110\n                        iso_currency_code: USD\n                        limit: null\n                        unofficial_currency_code: null\n                      mask: \"0000\"\n                      name: Plaid Checking\n                      official_name: Plaid Gold Standard 0% Interest Checking\n                      subtype: checking\n                      type: depository\n                    - account_id: 6PdjjRP6LmugpBy5NgQvUqpRXMWxzktg3rwrk\n                      balances:\n                        available: null\n                        current: 23631.9805\n                        iso_currency_code: USD\n                        limit: null\n                        unofficial_currency_code: null\n                      mask: \"6666\"\n                      name: Plaid 401k\n                      official_name: null\n                      subtype: 401k\n                      type: investment\n                    - account_id: XMBvvyMGQ1UoLbKByoMqH3nXMj84ALSdE5B58\n                      balances:\n                        available: null\n                        current: 65262\n                        iso_currency_code: USD\n                        limit: null\n                        unofficial_currency_code: null\n                      mask: \"7777\"\n                      name: Plaid Student Loan\n                      official_name: null\n                      subtype: student\n                      type: loan\n                    item:\n                      available_products:\n                      - balance\n                      - identity\n                      - payment_initiation\n                      - transactions\n                      billed_products:\n                      - assets\n                      - auth\n                      consent_expiration_time: null\n                      error: null\n                      institution_id: ins_117650\n                      item_id: DWVAAPWq4RHGlEaNyGKRTAnPLaEmo8Cvq7na6\n                      update_type: background\n                      webhook: https://www.genericwebhookurl.com/webhook\n                    request_id: bkVE1BHWMAZ9Rnr\n        default:\n          description: Error response.\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Error'\n      requestBody:\n        description: Request payload\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/AccountsGetRequest'\n            examples:\n              example-1:\n                value:\n                  client_id: string\n                  secret: string\n                  access_token: string\n                  options:\n                    account_ids:\n                    - string\n  /categories/get:\n    post:\n      security: []\n      tags:\n      - plaid\n      summary: Get Categories\n      externalDocs:\n        url: /api/products/#categoriesget\n      operationId: categoriesGet\n      description: Send a request to the `/categories/get`  endpoint to get detailed information on categories returned by Plaid.

Payments can be one-time or standing order (recurring) and can be denominated in either EUR or GBP.  If making domestic GBP-denominated payments, your recipient must have been created with BACS numbers. In general, EUR-denominated payments will be sent via SEPA Credit Transfer and GBP-denominated payments will be sent via the Faster Payments network, but the payment network used will be determined by the institution. Payments sent via Faster Payments will typically arrive immediately, while payments sent via SEPA Credit Transfer will typically arrive in one business day.\n\n        Standing orders (recurring payments) must be denominated in GBP and can only be sent to recipients in the UK. Once created, standing order payments cannot be modified or canceled via the API. An end user can cancel or modify a standing order directly on their banking application or website, or by contacting the bank. Standing orders will follow the payment rules of the underlying rails (Faster Payments in UK). Payments can be sent Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays. If the pre-arranged date falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the payment is made on the next working day. It is not possible to guarantee the exact time the payment will reach the recipient’s account, although at least 90% of standing order payments are sent by 6am.\n\n        In the Development environment, payments must be below 5 GBP / EUR. For details on any payment limits in Production, contact your Plaid Account Manager.\n      requestBody:\n        description: Request payload\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/PaymentInitiationPaymentCreateRequest'\n  /payment_initiation/payment/token/create:\n    post:\n      tags:\n      - plaid\n      deprecated: true\n      summary: Create payment token\n      externalDocs:\n        url: /link/maintain-legacy-integration/#creating-a-payment-token\n      operationId: createPaymentToken\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: OK\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/PaymentInitiationPaymentTokenCreateResponse'\n              examples:\n                example-1:\n                  value:\n                    payment_token: payment-token-sandbox-feca8a7a-5591-4aef-9297-f3062bb735d3\n                    payment_token_expiration_time: \"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z\"\n                    request_id: 4ciYVmesrySiUAB\n      description: |-\n        The `/payment_initiation/payment/token/create` endpoint has been deprecated.

An Audit Copy contains the same underlying data as the Asset Report.\n\n        To grant access to an Audit Copy, use the `/asset_report/audit_copy/create` endpoint to create an `audit_copy_token` and then pass that token to the third party who needs access. Each third party has its own `auditor_id`, for example `fannie_mae`. You’ll need to create a separate Audit Copy for each third party to whom you want to grant access to the Report.\n      requestBody:\n        description: Request payload\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/AssetReportAuditCopyCreateRequest'\n  /asset_report/audit_copy/remove:\n    post:\n      tags:\n      - plaid\n      summary: Remove Asset Report Audit Copy\n      externalDocs:\n        url: /api/products/#asset_reportaudit_copyremove\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: OK\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/AssetReportAuditCopyRemoveResponse'\n              examples:\n                example-1:\n                  value:\n                    removed: true\n                    request_id: m8MDnv9okwxFNBV\n      operationId: assetReportAuditCopyRemove\n      requestBody:\n        description: Request payload\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/AssetReportAuditCopyRemoveRequest'\n      description: The `/asset_report/audit_copy/remove` endpoint allows you to remove an Audit Copy. Removing an Audit Copy invalidates the `audit_copy_token` associated with it, meaning both you and any third parties holding the token will no longer be able to use it to access Report data. Items associated with the Asset Report, the Asset Report itself and other Audit Copies of it are not affected and will remain accessible after removing the given Audit Copy.\n  /investments/holdings/get:\n    post:\n      tags:\n      -
