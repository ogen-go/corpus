When shrinking a pool, the Batch service tries\n        to preserve compute nodes where Job Manager tasks are running for as\n        long as possible (that is, nodes running 'normal' tasks are removed\n        before nodes running Job Manager tasks). When a Job Manager task fails\n        and needs to be restarted, the system tries to schedule it at the\n        highest priority. If there are no idle nodes available, the system may\n        terminate one of the running tasks in the pool and return it to the\n        queue in order to make room for the Job Manager task to restart. Note\n        that a Job Manager task in one job does not have priority over tasks in\n        other jobs. Across jobs, only job level priorities are observed. For\n        example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 job needs to be restarted, it\n        will not displace tasks of a priority 1 job. Batch will retry tasks when\n        a recovery operation is triggered on a compute node. Examples of\n        recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy\n        compute node is rebooted or a compute node disappeared due to host\n        failure. Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are\n        not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount\n        is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because\n        of this, all tasks should be idempotent. This means tasks need to\n        tolerate being interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption\n        or duplicate data.

If the\n            subnet doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the pool will\n            partially allocate compute nodes, and a resize error will occur. For\n            pools created with virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual\n            networks ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but\n            for pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and\n            classic virtual networks are supported.

Brackets can include a\n            negation to match any character not specified (for example [!abc]\n            matches any character but a, b, or c). If a file name starts with\n            \\\".\\\" it is ignored by default but may be matched by specifying it\n            explicitly (for example *.gif will not match .a.gif, but .*.gif\n            will). A simple example: **\\\\*.txt matches any file that does not\n            start in '.' and ends with .txt in the task working directory or any\n            subdirectory.
