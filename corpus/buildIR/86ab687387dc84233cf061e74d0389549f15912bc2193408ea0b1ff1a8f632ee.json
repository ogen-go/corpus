The default policy, has the exactly same id\n        as the thing, and grants ALL permissions to the authorized subject.\n\n        In case you need to associate the new thing to an already existing policy you can additionally\n        set a policy e.g. \"policyId\": \"com.acme.coffeemaker:policy-1\" as the first element in the body part.\n        Keep in mind, that you can also change the assignment to another policy anytime,\n        with a request on the sub-resource \"PUT /things/{thingId}/policyId\"\n\n        The field `_created` is filled automatically with the timestamp of the creation. The field is read-only and can\n        be retrieved later by explicitly selecting it or used in search filters.\n\n        ### Update an existing thing\n\n        For updating an existing thing, the authorized subject needs **WRITE** permission on the thing's root resource.\n\n        The ID of a thing cannot be changed after creation. Any `thingId`\n        specified in the request body is therefore ignored.\n      tags:\n        - Things\n      parameters:\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/ThingIdPathParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/IfMatchHeaderParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/IfNoneMatchHeaderParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/PutMetadataParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/RequestedAcksParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/TimeoutParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/ResponseRequiredParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/ConditionParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/ChannelParam'\n      responses:\n        '201':\n          description: The thing was successfully created.\n          headers:\n            ETag:\n              description: |-\n                The (current server-side) ETag for this (sub-)resource.

The *WRITE* permission must not be revoked on any\n        level further down the hierarchy. Consequently it is also sufficient for the authorized subject to have\n        unrestricted *WRITE* permission at root level or unrestricted *WRITE* permission at `/attributes` and\n        `/features` etc.\n      tags:\n        - Things\n      parameters:\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/ThingIdPathParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/IfMatchHeaderParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/IfNoneMatchHeaderParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/PutMetadataParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/RequestedAcksParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/TimeoutParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/ResponseRequiredParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/ConditionParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/ChannelParam'\n      responses:\n        '204':\n          description: The thing was successfully patched.\n          headers:\n            ETag:\n              description: |-\n                The (current server-side) ETag for this (sub-)resource.

The \"claim\" message is forwarded\n        together with the request body and `Content-Type` header to client(s)\n        which registered for Claim messages of the specific thing.\n\n        The decision whether to grant access (by setting permissions) is\n        completely up to the client(s) which handle the \"claim\" message.\n\n        The HTTP request blocks until all acknowledgement requests are fulfilled.\n        By default, it blocks until a response to the issued \"claim\" message is\n        available or until the `timeout` is expired.

(Also note that '204 - No Content' status code\n        will never return a body, even if the client responded with a body).\n\n        ### Who\n        You will need `WRITE` permission on the root \"message:/\" resource, or at least\n        the resource `message:/inbox/messages/messageSubject`. The receiving device needs `READ` permission on the resource.\n        Such permission is managed within the policy which controls the access on the thing.\n\n        ### Example\n        Given you have a \"coffemaker\" thing as shown in the examples for the `things` resources.\n        The `messageSubject` understood by such a device would be \"makeCoffee\".\n\n        Further, as in our example the \"brewed-coffees\" counter would increase as a response, you would need `WRITE`\n        permission for the things resource, at least at the respective path\n\n        `/things/{thingId}/features/coffee-brewer/properties/brewed-coffees`\n      tags:\n        - Messages\n      parameters:\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/ThingIdPathParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/MessageSubjectPathParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/MessageTimeoutParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/LiveMessageRequestedAcksParam'\n      responses:\n        '202':\n          description: The message was sent but not necessarily received by the thing (fire and forget).\n        '400':\n          description: |-\n            The request could not be completed.

However, you can create a full-fledged policy all at once.\n\n        By default the authorized subject needs WRITE permission on the root resource of the created policy. You can\n        however omit this check by setting the parameter `allow-policy-lockout` to `true`.\n\n        Example: To create a policy for multiple coffee maker things,\n        which gives **yourself** all permissions on all resources, set the policyId in the path,\n        e.g. to \"com.acme.coffeemaker:policy-01\" and the body part, like in the following snippet.\n\n        ```\n        {\n          \"entries\": {\n            \"DEFAULT\": {\n              \"subjects\": {\n                \"{{ request:subjectId }}\": {\n                  \"type\": \"the creator\"\n                }\n              },\n              \"resources\": {\n                \"policy:/\": {\n                  \"grant\": [\n                    \"READ\",\n                    \"WRITE\"\n                  ],\n                  \"revoke\": []\n                },\n                \"thing:/\": {\n                  \"grant\": [\n                    \"READ\",\n                    \"WRITE\"\n                  ],\n                  \"revoke\": []\n                },\n                \"message:/\": {\n                  \"grant\": [\n                    \"READ\",\n                    \"WRITE\"\n                  ],\n                  \"revoke\": []\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n\n        ### Update an existing policy\n        For updating an existing policy, the authorized subject needs WRITE permission on the policy's root resource.\n\n        The ID of a policy cannot be changed after creation. Any `policyId` specified in the request body is therefore ignored.\n\n        ### Partially update an existing policy\n        Partial updates are not supported.\n\n        If you need to create or update a specific label, resource, or subject, please use the respective sub-resources.\n      tags:\n        - Policies\n      parameters:\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/PolicyIdPathParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/IfMatchHeaderParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/IfNoneMatchHeaderParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/TimeoutParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/ResponseRequiredParam'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/AllowPolicyLockoutParam'\n      responses:\n        '201':\n          description: The policy was successfully created.\n          headers:\n            ETag:\n              description: |-\n                The (current server-side) ETag for this (sub-)resource.
