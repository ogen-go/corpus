When shrinking a Pool, the Batch service tries\n        to preserve Nodes where Job Manager Tasks are running for as long as\n        possible (that is, Compute Nodes running 'normal' Tasks are removed\n        before Compute Nodes running Job Manager Tasks). When a Job Manager Task\n        fails and needs to be restarted, the system tries to schedule it at the\n        highest priority. If there are no idle Compute Nodes available, the\n        system may terminate one of the running Tasks in the Pool and return it\n        to the queue in order to make room for the Job Manager Task to restart.\n        Note that a Job Manager Task in one Job does not have priority over\n        Tasks in other Jobs. Across Jobs, only Job level priorities are\n        observed. For example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 Job needs to be\n        restarted, it will not displace Tasks of a priority 1 Job. Batch will\n        retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node.
