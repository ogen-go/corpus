The Parse API can then POST the parsed emails to a URL that you specify. The Inbound Parse Webhook cannot parse messages greater than 20MB in size, including all attachments.\n\n\n        There are a number of pre-made integrations for the SendGrid Parse Webhook which make processing events easy. You can find these integrations in the [Library Index](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Integrate/libraries.html#-Webhook-Libraries).\n      operationId: GET_user-webhooks-parse-stats\n      parameters:\n        - description: The number of statistics to return on each page.\n          in: query\n          name: limit\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: The number of statistics to skip.\n          in: query\n          name: offset\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: \"How you would like the statistics to by grouped. \"\n          in: query\n          name: aggregated_by\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            enum:\n              - day\n              - week\n              - month\n            type: string\n        - description: The starting date of the statistics you want to retrieve.

Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record.\n\n\n        For more information on whitelabeling, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/Whitelabel/index.html)\n      operationId: GET_whitelabel-domains\n      parameters:\n        -

Use the \"username\" parameter. This allows you to create a whitelabel on behalf of your subuser. This means the subuser is able to see and modify the created whitelabel.\n\n        2. Use the Association workflow (see Associate Domain section). This allows you to assign a whitelabel created by the parent to a subuser. This means the subuser will default to the assigned whitelabel, but will not be able to see or modify that whitelabel. However, if the subuser creates their own whitelabel it will overwrite the assigned whitelabel.\n\n\n        A domain whitelabel allows you to remove the “via” or “sent on behalf of” message that your recipients see when they read your emails. Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record.\n\n\n        For more information on whitelabeling, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/Whitelabel/index.html)\n      operationId: POST_whitelabel-domains\n      parameters:\n        - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/trait_onBehalfOfSubuser_on-behalf-of\"\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              example:\n                automatic_security: false\n                custom_spf: true\n                default: true\n                domain: example.com\n                ips:\n                  - 192.168.1.1\n                  - 192.168.1.2\n                subdomain: news\n                username: john@example.com\n              properties:\n                automatic_security:\n                  description: Whether to allow SendGrid to manage your SPF records, DKIM keys,\n                    and DKIM key rotation.\n                  type: boolean\n                custom_spf:\n                  description: Specify whether to use a custom SPF or allow SendGrid to manage\n                    your SPF.

This functionality allows\n\n        subusers to send mail using their parent's linke whitelabels. To associate a link whitelabel, the parent account\n\n        must first create a whitelabel and validate it. The parent may then associate that whitelabel with a subuser via the API or the Subuser Management page in the user interface.\n\n\n        Email link whitelabels allow all of the click-tracked links you send in your emails to include the URL of your domain instead of sendgrid.net.\n\n\n        For more information, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Whitelabel/links.html).\n      operationId: POST_whitelabel-links-link_id-subuser\n      parameters:\n        -
