In most cases, you'll want to build a search interface that uses one of the 3 provided schemas: `lat` and `lon` (using e.g. the HTML5 Geolocation API), `city` and `state`, _or_ the generic `q` query which can accept a station name, call letters, network name, or zip code. Technically speaking, `q` can also take in either a city name or a state name, but using the `city` and `state` parameters together will yield more accurate geographic search results than `q={cityName}`.\n\n\n        The `lat` and `lon` query parameters should always be passed in together (otherwise the API will return a 400 error), and if included in the query, they will take precedence over any other search criteria; that is, `lat` and `lon` will do a purely geographic search and not take into account `q`, `city` or `state`.\n\n\n        Similarly, `city` and/or `state` will take precedence over (and ignore) `q`.\n\n\n        If clients want to be able to offer multiple types of searches (e.g. 'Search for a station name, city or zipcode') using a *single* search input form, `q` should be used. But again, be aware that using `city` and `state` together will yield more accurate search results than `q={cityName}`.\n      operationId: searchStations\n      parameters:\n        - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/Authorization\"\n        - description: Search terms to search on;
