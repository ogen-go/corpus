For example:\n\n      * Modern browsers limit the number of requests that a single web page can\n        make at once.\n      * Mobile apps will use more battery life to keep the cellular radio on\n        when making a series of requests.\n      * There is an overhead cost to developing software that can make multiple\n        requests in parallel.\n      * Some cloud platforms handle parallelism poorly, or disallow it\n        entirely.\n\n\n      To make development easier in these use cases, Asana provides a **batch API** that enables developers to perform multiple “actions” by making only a single HTTP request.\n\n      #### Making a Batch Request\n\n      To make a batch request, send a `POST` request to `/batch`. Like other `POST` endpoints, the body should contain a `data` envelope. Inside this envelope should be a single `actions` field, containing a list of “action” objects.  Each action represents a standard request to an existing endpoint in the Asana API.\n\n      **The maximum number of actions allowed in a single batch request is 10**. Making a batch request with no actions in it will result in a `400 Bad Request`.\n\n      When the batch API receives the list of actions to execute, it will dispatch those actions to the already-implemented endpoints specified by the `relative_path` and `method` for each action. This happens in parallel, so all actions in the request will be processed simultaneously. There is no guarantee of the execution order for these actions, nor is there a way to use the output of one action as the input of another action (such as creating a task and then commenting on it).\n\n      The response to the batch request will contain (within the `data` envelope) a list of result objects, one for each action. The results are guaranteed to be in the same order as the actions in the request, e.g., the first result in the response corresponds to the first action in the request.\n\n      The batch API will always attempt to return a `200 Success` response with individual result objects for each individual action in the request. Only in certain cases (such as missing authorization or malformed JSON in the body) will the entire request fail with another status code. Even if every individual action in the request fails, the batch API will still return a `200 Success` response, and each result object in the response will contain the errors encountered with each action.\n\n      #### Rate Limiting\n\n      The batch API fully respects all of our rate limiting. This means that a batch request counts against *both* the standard rate limiter and the concurrent request limiter as though you had made a separate HTTP request for every individual action. For example, a batch request with five actions counts as five separate requests in the standard rate limiter, and counts as five concurrent requests in the concurrent request limiter. The batch request itself incurs no cost.\n\n      If any of the actions in a batch request would exceed any of the enforced limits, the *entire* request will fail with a `429 Too Many Requests` error. This is to prevent the unpredictability of which actions might succeed if not all of them could succeed.\n\n      #### Restrictions\n\n      Not every endpoint can be accessed through the batch API. Specifically, the following actions cannot be taken and will result in a `400 Bad Request` for that action:\n\n      * Uploading attachments\n      * Creating, getting, or deleting organization exports\n      * Any SCIM operations\n      * Nested calls to the batch API\n    name: Batch API\n  - description: |-\n      In the Asana application, Tasks, Projects, and Portfolios can hold user-specified Custom Fields which provide extra information; for example, a priority value or a number representing the time required to complete a Task. This lets a user define the type of information that each Item within a Project or Portfolio can contain in addition to the built-in fields that Asana provides.\n\n      **Note:** Custom Fields are a premium feature. Integrations which work with Custom Fields need to handle an assortment of use cases for free and premium users in context of free and premium organizations. For a detailed examination of to what data users will have access in different circumstances, read the section below on access control.\n\n      `display_value` is a read-only field that will always be a string. For apps that use custom fields, this is a great way to safely display/export the value of a custom field, regardless of its type. We suggest apps use this field in order to future-proof for changes to Custom Fields.\n\n      The characteristics of Custom Fields are:\n\n      * There is metadata that defines the Custom Field. This metadata can be shared across an entire workspace, or be specific to a Project or Portfolio.\n      * Creating a Custom Field Setting on a Project or Portfolio means each direct child will have the custom field. This is conceptually akin to adding columns in a database or a spreadsheet: every Task (row) in the Project (table) can contain information for that field, including \"blank\" values, i.e. `null` data. For Portfolio custom fields, every Project (row) in the Portfolio (table) will contain information for the custom field.\n      * Custom Field Settings only go one child deep. Meaning a custom field setting on a portfolio will give each project the custom field, but not each task within those projects.\n      * Tasks have Custom Field _values_ assigned to them.\n\n      A brief example: let's imagine that an organization has defined a Custom Field for \"Priority\". This field is of `enum` type and can have user-defined values of `Low`, `Medium`, or `High`. This is the field metadata, and it is visible within, and shared across, the entire organization.\n\n      A Project is then created in the organization, called \"Bugs\", and the \"Priority\" Custom Field is associated with that Project. This will allow all Tasks within the \"Bugs\" Project to have an associated \"Priority\".\n\n      A new Task is created within \"Bugs\". This Task, then, has a field named \"Priority\" which can take on the Custom Field value of one of `[null]`, `Low`, `Medium`, and `High`.\n\n      These Custom Fields are accessible via the API through a number of endpoints at the top level (e.g. `/custom_fields` and `/custom_field_settings`) and through calls on Workspaces, Portfolios, Projects, and Tasks resources. The API also provides a way to fetch both the metadata and data which define each particular Custom Field, so that a client application may render proper UI to display or edit the values.\n\n      Custom Field aware integrations need to be aware of the basic types that Custom Fields can adopt. These types are:\n\n      * `text` - an arbitrary, relatively short string of text\n      * `number` - a number with a defined level of precision\n      * `enum` - a selection from a defined list of options\n\n      Text fields are currently limited to 1024 characters. On Tasks, their Custom Field value will have a `text_value` property to represent this field.\n\n      Number fields can have an arbitrary `precision` associated with them; for example, a precision of `2` would round its value to the second (hundredths) place, i.e. 1.2345 would round to 1.23. On Tasks, the Custom Field value will have a `number_value` property to represent this field.\n\n      Enum fields represent a selection from a list of options. On the metadata, they will contain all of the options in an array. Each option has 4 properties:\n\n      * `gid` - the gid of this enum option. Note that this is the gid of the _option_ - the Custom Field itself has a separate `gid`.\n      * `name` - the name of the option, e.g. \"Choice #1\"\n      * `enabled` - whether this field is enabled. Disabled fields are not available to choose from when disabled, and are visually hidden in the Asana application, but they remain in the metadata for Custom Field values which were set to the option before the option was disabled.\n      * `color` - a color associated with this choice.\n\n      On the Task's Custom Field value, the enum will have an `enum_value` property which will be the same as one of the choices from the list defined in the Custom Field metadata.\n\n      #### Querying an organization for its Custom Fields\n\n      For Custom Fields shared across the workspace or organization, the Workspace [can be queried](/docs/get-a-workspace-39-s-custom-fields) for its list of defined Custom Fields. Like other collection queries, the fields will be returned as a compact record; slightly different from most other compact records is the fact that the compact record for Custom Fields includes `type` as well as `gid` and `name`.\n\n      #### Accessing Custom Field definitions\n\n      The [Custom Fields](/docs/get-a-custom-field) reference describes how the metadata which defines a Custom Field is accessed. A GET request with a `gid` can be issued on the `/custom_fields` endpoint to fetch the full definition of a single Custom Field given its `gid` from (for instance) listing all Custom Fields on a Workspace, or getting the `gid` from a Custom Field Settings object or a Task.\n\n      #### Associating Custom Fields with a Project or Portfolio\n\n      A mapping between a Custom Field and a Project or Portfolio is handled with a [Custom Field Settings](/docs/asana-custom-field-settings) object. This object contains a reference for each of the Custom Field and the Project or Porfolio, as well as additional information about the status of that particular Custom Field. For instance, `is_important`, which defines whether or not the custom field will appear in the list/grid on the Asana application.\n\n      #### Accessing Custom Field values on Tasks or Projects\n\n      The [Tasks](/docs/get-a-task) reference has information on how Custom Fields look on Tasks. Custom Fields will return as an array on the property `custom_fields`, and each entry will contain, side-by-side, the compact representation of the Custom Field metadata and a `{typename}_value` property that stores the value set for the Custom Field.\n\n      Of particular note is that the top-level `gid` of each entry in the `custom_fields` array is the `gid` of the Custom Field metadata, as it is the compact representation of this metadata. This can be used to refer to the full metadata by making a request to the `/custom_fields/{custom_fields_id}` endpoint as described above.\n\n      Custom Fields can be set just as in the Asana-defined fields on a task via POST or PUT requests. You can see an example on the [update a task](/docs/update-a-task) endpoint.\n\n      Custom Fields on projects follow this same pattern.\n\n      #### Warning: Program defensively with regards to Custom Field definitions\n\n      Asana application users have the ability to change the definitions of Custom Field metadata. This means that as you write scripts or applications to work with them, it's possible for the definitions to change at any time, which may cause an application using them to break or malfunction if it makes assumptions about the metadata for a particular Custom Field. When using Custom Fields, it is a good idea to program *defensively*, meaning you your application should double-check that the Custom Field metadata is what it expects.\n\n      Storing the state of the Custom Field metadata for too long if you dynamically create a model for it can cause your model to become unsynchronized with the model stored in Asana. If you encounter (for example) an `enum` value on a Task that does not match any option in your metadata model, your metadata model has become out of date with the Custom Field metadata.\n\n      **Note:** We are currently studying proposals for future implementations to more elegantly handle the modification of Custom Field metadata for application integrations.\n\n      #### Enabled and Disabled Values\n\n      When information that is contained in a Custom Field value loses a logical association with its metadata definition, the value becomes disabled. This can happen in a couple of simple ways, for example, if you remove the Custom Field metadata from a Project, or move a Task with a Custom Field to a different Project which does not have the Custom Field metadata associated with it. The value remains on the Task, and the Custom Field metadata can still be found and examined, but as the context in which the Custom Field makes sense is gone, the Custom Field cannot change its value; it can only be cleared.\n\n      Note: Tasks that are associated with multiple Projects do not become disabled, so long as at least one of the Projects is still associated with the Custom Field metadata. In other words, Tasks with multiple Projects will retain logically associated to the set of Custom Field metadata represented by all of their Projects.\n\n      Moving the Task back under a Project with that Custom Field applied to it or applying the Custom Field metadata to the current Project will return the Custom Field value to an enabled state. In this scenario, the Custom Field will be re-enabled and editable again.\n\n      In the Asana application, disabled fields are grayed out and not allowed to change, other than to be discarded. In the API, we return a property `enabled: false` to inform the external application that the value has been disabled.\n\n      Note that the API enforces the same operations on disabled Custom Field values as hold in the Asana application: they may not have their values changed, since the lack of context for the values of a custom field in general doesn't provide enough information to know what new values should be. Setting the Custom Field value to `null` will clear and remove the Custom Field value from the Task.\n\n      #### Custom Field access control\n\n      Custom Fields are a complex feature of the Asana platform, and their access in the Asana application and in the API vary based on the status of the user and project. When building your application, it's best to be defensive and not assume the given user will have read or write access to a custom field, and fail gracefully when this occurs.\n    name: Custom Fields\n  - description: Custom fields are attached to a particular project with the Custom Field Settings resource. This resource both represents the many-to-many join of the Custom Field and Project as well as stores information that is relevant to that particular pairing; for instance, the `is_important` property determines some possible application-specific handling of that custom field.\n    name: Custom Field Settings\n  - description: |-\n      An *event* is an object representing a change to a resource that was observed by an event subscription.\n\n      In general, requesting events on a resource is faster and subject to higher rate limits than requesting the resource itself. Additionally, change events bubble up - listening to events on a project would include when stories are added to tasks in the project, even on subtasks.\n\n      Establish an initial sync token by making a request with no sync token. The response will be a `412` error - the same as if the sync token had expired.\n\n      Subsequent requests should always provide the sync token from the immediately preceding call.\n\n      Sync tokens may not be valid if you attempt to go ‘backward’ in the history by requesting previous tokens, though re-requesting the current sync token is generally safe, and will always return the same results.\n\n      When you receive a `412 Precondition Failed` error, it means that the sync token is either invalid or expired. If you are attempting to keep a set of data in sync, this signals you may need to re-crawl the data.\n\n      Sync tokens always expire after 24 hours, but may expire sooner, depending on load on the service.\n    name: Events\n  - description: A `goal` is an object in the goal-tracking system that helps your organization drive measurable results.\n    name: Goals\n  - description: |-\n      Jobs represent processes that handle asynchronous work.\n      Jobs are created when an endpoint requests an action that will be handled asynchronously.

Followers of a project will receive all updates including tasks created, added and removed from that project. Members of the project have access to and will receive status updates of the project.

We are in the process of transferring the webhooks system to a more reliable infrastructure while also iteratively improving the current system. As such, for the time being we advise against using webhooks for functionality beyond logging (e.g., syncing state with real-time notification data).*\n      *If you experience latency issues, we recommend using webhooks in conjunction with fetching the resource periodically (e.g. [GET a task](https://developers.asana.com/docs/get-a-task)).  More details and ongoing updates can be found in [this post](https://forum.asana.com/t/upcoming-improvements-to-our-webhooks-system/126570) in the developer forum.*\n      Webhooks allow an application to be notified of changes in Asana.\n\n      This is similar to our [Events](/docs/asana-events) resource, but webhooks \"push\" events via HTTP `POST` rather than expecting integrations to repeatedly \"poll\" for them. For services that are already accessible on the Internet this is often more convenient and efficient.\n\n      However, webhooks _require_ a server to be accessible over the internet at all times to receive the event. For most simple integrations, Events provide much of the same benefits while using a significantly simpler implementation which does not require maintaining an internet-accessible server.\n\n      #### The webhook \"handshake\"\n      In order to ensure that the receiving server is available to receive incoming events from a webhook Asana will `POST` to the requested target endpoint during the webhook creation request. In other words, the outgoing webhook creation request will wait to return until another full `POST` request from Asana's servers to the target has been completed, *then* the webhook creation request can return with a successful response.\n\n      *Note: this means that your server must be able to handle being blocked on the outgoing create request while still being able to receive and handle an incoming request. A common reason that webhook handshakes fail is that servers are not able to asynchronously handle the handshake request.*\n\n      Included in the webhook handshake is a HTTP header called `X-Hook-Secret`.  To successfully complete the handshake the receiving server should echo back the same header with the same value and a `200 OK` or `204 No Content` response code.\n\n      The purpose of this header is to provide a shared secret that both Asana and the receiving server both store--this is the only time it will be transmitted. In future webhook events Asana will use this key to compute a signature over the webhook callback request's body which can be used to verify that the incoming request was genuine (details below). We strongly recommend that you take advantage of this security feature and reject webhooks that have an invalid signature.\n\n      #### Receiving Events\n\n      Because multiple events often happen in short succession, a webhook payload is designed to be able to transmit multiple events at once. The schema of these events is described in [Event](/docs/tocS_Event).\n\n      The HTTP POST that the target receives contains:\n\n\n       * An `X-Hook-Signature` header, which allows verifying that the payload\n       is genuine.  The signature is a SHA256 HMAC signature computed on the\n       request body using the shared secret transmitted during the handshake.\n       Verification is **strongly recommended**, as it would otherwise be\n       possible for an attacker to POST a malicious payload to the same\n       endpoint.\n       * A JSON body with a single key, `events`, containing an array of the\n       events that have occurred since the last webhook delivery. (Note that this\n       list may be empty, as periodically we send a \"heartbeat\" webhook to\n       verify that the endpoint is still available.)\n\n\n      Note that events are \"skinny\" and contain only some basic details of the change, not the whole resource. We expect integrations to make additional calls to the API to retrieve the latest state from Asana.\n\n      #### Filtering\n      Webhook events will \"propagate up\" from contained objects through to parent objects--for instance, changes to comments will be sent to webhooks on the parent task and to ones on the task's projects. In this way a webhook on a project will be notified of all changes that occur in all of its tasks, subtasks of those tasks, and comments on those tasks and subtasks.\n\n      This can be a lot of data, some of which might not be relevant to a particular integration, so Asana's webhooks have a filtering feature which allows integrations to specify only the types of changes that they care about. By specifying the list of [WebhookFilter](/docs/tocS_WebhookFilter)s on webhook creation an integration can select just the subset of events it wants to receive.  When filters are specified on the webhook events will only be delivered if they pass any of the filters specified when creating the webhook.\n\n      To reduce the volume of data to transfer, webhooks created on teams, portfolios, and workspaces *must* specify filters. In addition, the set of event filters that can be placed on a team-level or workspace-level webhook is more limited than filters for webhooks that are created on lower-level resources:\n\n\n       * Webhook events from tasks, subtasks, and stories won't be propagated\n       to these higher-level webhooks, so all changes on these resources are\n       automatically filtered out.\n       * Webhook events from `project` resources can be filtered for these\n       `action`s: `added`, `removed`, `deleted`, `undeleted`, and `changed`.\n       * Webhook events from `team_membership` resources can be filtered to\n       `action`s `added` and `removed`.\n       * Webhook events from `workspace_membership` resources can be filtered\n       to `added` and `removed`.\n\n\n      #### Error Handling and Retry\n\n      If we attempt to send a webhook payload and we receive an error status code, or the request times out, we will retry delivery with exponential backoff. In general, if your servers are not available for an hour, you can expect it to take no longer than approximately an hour after they come back before the paused delivery resumes. However, if we are unable to deliver a message for 24 hours the webhook will be deactivated.\n      #### Webhook Heartbeat Events\n      Webhooks keep track of the last time that delivery succeeded, and this time is updated with each success. To help facilitate this, webhooks have a “heartbeat” that will deliver an empty payload at the initial handshake, and then every eight hours. This way, even if there is no activity on the resource, the last success time (i.e `last_success_at`) will still be updated continuously.\n      #### Resources and Actions\n      This is not an exhaustive list, but should cover the most common use cases.\n\n\n       * Attachment - deleted, undeleted\n       * Portfolio - added, deleted, removed\n       * Project - added, changed, deleted, removed, undeleted\n       * Project Membership - added, removed\n       * Section - added, changed, deleted, undeleted\n       * Story - added, removed, undeleted\n       * Tag - added, changed, deleted, undeleted\n       * Task - added, changed, deleted, removed, undeleted\n       * Team - added, changed, deleted\n       * Team Membership - added, removed\n       * Workspace - added, removed, changed\n       * Workspace Memberships - added, removed\n\n\n      #### Webhook Limits\n\n      Webhooks have two different limits\n\n       * 1k limit per resource in Asana. (If 10 apps each have 100 webhooks\n         watching the same resource, no more webhooks can be placed on the\n         webhook. `/events` streams count towards this limit)\n       * 10k per user-app (An app can have 10k webhooks for EACH user)\n\n      #### Example Integration: Webhook Inspector\n      The [Webhook Inspector](https://github.com/Asana/devrel-examples/tree/master/python/webhooks) is a Python script that demonstrates the features of Asana webhooks, including how to both properly set them up and receive them. By using this script, you can create a webhook and log the contents of incoming notifications to your console.\n      To use this demo, be sure to generate a new [personal access token](https://developers.asana.com/docs/personal-access-token), then follow the instructions in README.\n    name: Webhooks\n  - description: |-\n      A *workspace* is the highest-level organizational unit in Asana. All projects and tasks have an associated workspace.\n\n      An *organization* is a special kind of workspace that represents a company. In an organization, you can group your projects into teams. You can read more about how organizations work on the Asana Guide. To tell if your workspace is an organization or not, check its `is_organization` property.\n\n      Over time, we intend to migrate most workspaces into organizations and to release more organization-specific functionality. We may eventually deprecate using workspace-based APIs for organizations. Currently, and until after some reasonable grace period following any further announcements, you can still reference organizations in any `workspace` parameter.\n    name: Workspaces\n  - description: This object determines if a user is a member of a workspace.\n    name: Workspace Memberships\npaths:\n  \"/attachments/{attachment_gid}\":\n    delete:\n      description: |-\n        Deletes a specific, existing attachment.\n\n        Returns an empty data record.\n      operationId: deleteAttachment\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                properties:\n                  data:\n                    $ref: \"#/components/schemas/EmptyResponse\"\n                type: object\n          description: Successfully deleted the specified attachment.\n        \"400\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/BadRequest\"\n        \"401\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/Unauthorized\"\n        \"403\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/Forbidden\"\n        \"404\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/NotFound\"\n        \"500\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/InternalServerError\"\n      summary: Delete an attachment\n      tags:\n        - Attachments\n    get:\n      description: Get the full record for a single attachment.\n      operationId: getAttachment\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                properties:\n                  data:\n                    $ref: \"#/components/schemas/AttachmentResponse\"\n                type: object\n          description: Successfully retrieved the record for a single attachment.\n        \"400\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/BadRequest\"\n        \"401\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/Unauthorized\"\n        \"402\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/PaymentRequired\"\n        \"403\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/Forbidden\"\n        \"404\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/NotFound\"\n        \"424\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/TooManyRequests\"\n        \"500\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/InternalServerError\"\n        \"501\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/BadGateway\"\n        \"503\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/ServiceUnavailable\"\n        \"504\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/GatewayTimeout\"\n      summary: Get an attachment\n      tags:\n        - Attachments\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/attachment_path_gid\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/pretty\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/fields\"\n  /batch:\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/pretty\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/fields\"\n    post:\n      description: Make multiple requests in parallel to Asana's API.\n      operationId: createBatchRequest\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              properties:\n                data:\n                  $ref: \"#/components/schemas/BatchRequest\"\n              type: object\n        description: The requests to batch together via the Batch API.\n        required: true\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                properties:\n                  data:\n                    items:\n                      $ref: \"#/components/schemas/BatchResponse\"\n                    type: array\n                type: object\n          description: Successfully completed the requested batch API operations.\n        \"400\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/BadRequest\"\n        \"401\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/Unauthorized\"\n        \"403\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/Forbidden\"\n        \"404\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/NotFound\"\n        \"500\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/InternalServerError\"\n      summary: Submit parallel requests\n      tags:\n        - Batch API\n  /custom_fields:\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/pretty\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/fields\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/limit\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/offset\"\n    post:\n      description: |-\n        Creates a new custom field in a workspace.

First, a simple HTTP POST\n        request initiates the creation similar to creating any other resource.\n\n        Next, in the middle of this request comes the confirmation handshake.\n        When a webhook is created, we will send a test POST to the target with an\n        `X-Hook-Secret` header. The target must respond with a `200 OK` or `204\n        No Content` and a matching `X-Hook-Secret` header to confirm that this\n        webhook subscription is indeed expected. We strongly recommend storing\n        this secret to be used to verify future webhook event signatures.\n\n        The POST request to create the webhook will then return with the status\n        of the request. If you do not acknowledge the webhook’s confirmation\n        handshake it will fail to setup, and you will receive an error in\n        response to your attempt to create it. This means you need to be able to\n        receive and complete the webhook *while* the POST request is in-flight\n        (in other words, have a server that can handle requests asynchronously).\n\n        Invalid hostnames like localhost will recieve a 403 Forbidden status code.\n\n        ```\n        # Request\n        curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer <personal_access_token>\" \\\n        -X POST https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/webhooks \\\n        -d \"resource=8675309\" \\\n        -d \"target=https://example.com/receive-webhook/7654\"\n        ```\n\n        ```\n        # Handshake sent to https://example.com/\n        POST /receive-webhook/7654\n        X-Hook-Secret: b537207f20cbfa02357cf448134da559e8bd39d61597dcd5631b8012eae53e81\n        ```\n\n        ```\n        # Handshake response sent by example.com\n        HTTP/1.1 200\n        X-Hook-Secret: b537207f20cbfa02357cf448134da559e8bd39d61597dcd5631b8012eae53e81\n        ```\n\n        ```\n        # Response\n        HTTP/1.1 201\n        {\n          \"data\": {\n            \"gid\": \"43214\",\n            \"resource\": {\n              \"gid\": \"8675309\",\n              \"name\": \"Bugs\"\n            },\n            \"target\": \"https://example.com/receive-webhook/7654\",\n            \"active\": false,\n            \"last_success_at\": null,\n            \"last_failure_at\": null,\n            \"last_failure_content\": null\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n      operationId: createWebhook\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              properties:\n                data:\n                  $ref: \"#/components/schemas/WebhookRequest\"\n              type: object\n        description: The webhook workspace and target.\n        required: true\n      responses:\n        \"201\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                properties:\n                  data:\n                    $ref: \"#/components/schemas/WebhookResponse\"\n                type: object\n          description: Successfully created the requested webhook.\n        \"400\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/BadRequest\"\n        \"401\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/Unauthorized\"\n        \"403\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/Forbidden\"\n        \"404\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/NotFound\"\n        \"500\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/InternalServerError\"\n      summary: Establish a webhook\n      tags:\n        - Webhooks\n  \"/webhooks/{webhook_gid}\":\n    delete:\n      description: This method *permanently* removes a webhook.

A user is premium if any of the following is true:\n\n        - The workspace in which the search is being performed is a premium workspace - The user is a member of a premium team inside the workspace\n\n        Even if a user is only a member of a premium team inside a non-premium workspace, search will allow them to find data anywhere in the workspace, not just inside the premium team. Making a search request using credentials of a non-premium user will result in a `402 Payment Required` error.\n        #### Pagination\n        Search results are not stable; repeating the same query multiple times may return the data in a different order, even if the data do not change. Because of this, the traditional [pagination](https://developers.asana.com/docs/#pagination) available elsewhere in the Asana API is not available here. However, you can paginate manually by sorting the search results by their creation time and then modifying each subsequent query to exclude data you have already seen. Page sizes are limited to a maximum of 100 items, and can be specified by the `limit` query parameter.\n        #### Eventual consistency\n        Changes in Asana (regardless of whether they’re made though the web product or the API) are forwarded to our search infrastructure to be indexed. This process can take between 10 and 60 seconds to complete under normal operation, and longer during some production incidents. Making a change to a task that would alter its presence in a particular search query will not be reflected immediately. This is also true of the advanced search feature in the web product.\n        #### Rate limits\n        You may receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response if you hit any of our [rate limits](https://developers.asana.com/docs/#rate-limits).\n        #### Custom field parameters\n        | Parameter name | Custom field type | Accepted type |\n        |---|---|---|\n        | custom_fields.{gid}.is_set | All | Boolean |\n        | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Text | String |\n        | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Number | Number |\n        | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Enum | Enum option ID |\n        | custom_fields.{gid}.starts_with | Text only | String |\n        | custom_fields.{gid}.ends_with | Text only | String |\n        | custom_fields.{gid}.contains | Text only | String |\n        | custom_fields.{gid}.less_than | Number only | Number |\n        | custom_fields.{gid}.greater_than | Number only | Number |\n\n\n        For example, if the gid of the custom field is 12345, these query parameter to find tasks where it is set would be `custom_fields.12345.is_set=true`. To match an exact value for an enum custom field, use the gid of the desired enum option and not the name of the enum option: `custom_fields.12345.value=67890`.\n\n        Searching for multiple exact matches of a custom field is not supported.\n\n        *Note: If you specify `projects.any` and `sections.any`, you will receive tasks for the project **and** tasks for the section. If you're looking for only tasks in a section, omit the `projects.any` from the request.*\n      operationId: searchTasksForWorkspace\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                properties:\n                  data:\n                    items:\n                      $ref: \"#/components/schemas/TaskCompact\"\n                    type: array\n                type: object\n          description: Successfully retrieved the section's tasks.\n        \"400\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/BadRequest\"\n        \"401\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/Unauthorized\"\n        \"403\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/Forbidden\"\n        \"404\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/NotFound\"\n        \"500\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/InternalServerError\"\n      summary: Search tasks in a workspace\n      tags:\n        -

This is\n        determined when the user visits the project, is added to the project, and\n        completes tasks in the project.\n\n        Resources with type `task` are returned with priority placed on tasks\n        the user is following, but no guarantee on the order of those tasks.\n\n        Leaving the `query` string empty or omitted will give you results, still\n        following the resource ordering above.

Instead, enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other attributes can be updated similarly.\n\n            On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`, meaning the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field. Setting `enabled=false` is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option in the Asana web app within the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option will no longer be selectable but, if the enum option value was previously set within a task, the task will retain the value.\n\n            Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options are inserted at the end.

These phrases are automatically generated using the\n        [node-asana-phrase\n        library](https://github.com/Asana/node-asana-phrase) and can be used by\n        Asana support to quickly look up the incident that caused the server\n        error.\n      properties:\n        errors:\n          items:\n            $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Error\"\n          type: array\n      type: object\n    EventResponse:\n      description: |-\n        An *event* is an object representing a change to a resource that was\n        observed by an event subscription or delivered asynchronously to\n        the target location of an active webhook.\n\n        The event may be triggered by a different `user` than the\n        subscriber. For example, if user A subscribes to a task and user B\n        modified it, the event’s user will be user B. Note: Some events\n        are generated by the system, and will have `null` as the user. API\n        consumers should make sure to handle this case.\n\n        The `resource` that triggered the event may be different from the one\n        that the events were requested for or the webhook is subscribed to. For\n        example, a subscription to a project will contain events for tasks\n        contained within the project.\n\n        **Note:** pay close attention to the relationship between the fields\n        `Event.action` and `Event.change.action`.\n        `Event.action` represents the action taken on the resource\n        itself, and `Event.change.action` represents how the information\n        within the resource's fields have been modified.\n\n        For instance, consider these scenarios:\n\n\n        * When at task is added to a project, `Event.action` will be\n        `added`, `Event.parent` will be on object with the `id` and\n        `type` of the project, and there will be no `change` field.\n\n\n        * When an assignee is set on the task, `Event.parent` will be\n        `null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`,\n        `Event.change.action` will be `changed`, and `changed_value` will\n        be an object with the user's `id` and `type`.\n\n\n        * When a collaborator is added to the task, `Event.parent` will\n        be `null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`,\n        `Event.change.action` will be `added`, and `added_value` will be\n        an object with the user's `id` and `type`.\n      properties:\n        action:\n          description: The type of action taken on the **resource** that triggered the event.
