The report is generated based on the criteria you specify, including the report type, the report's dimensions and metrics, the report's start and end dates, the listings to include in the report, and more. Metrics are the quantitative measurements in the report while dimensions specify the attributes of the data included in the reports. For details on the required and optional fields for each report type, see Creating Promoted Listings reports. This call returns the URL to the report task in the Location response header, and the URL includes the report-task ID. Reports often take time to generate and it's common for this call to return an HTTP status of 202, which indicates the report is being generated. Call getReportTasks (or getReportTask with the report-task ID) to determine the status of a Promoted Listings report. When a report is complete, eBay sets its status to SUCCESS and you can download it using the URL returned in the reportHref field of the getReportTask call. Report files are tab-separated value gzip files with a file extension of .tsv.gz. Note: This call fails if you don't submit all the required fields for the specified report type.

Discounts can be specified as either a monetary amount or a percentage off the standard sales price. eBay highlights promoted items by placing teasers for the items throughout the online sales flows. Unlike an item promotion, a markdown promotion does not require the buyer meet a \u0026quot;threshold\u0026quot; before the offer takes effect. With markdown promotions, all the buyer needs to do is purchase the item to receive the promotion benefit. Important: You can create item price markdown promotions only for specific listings. For complete details, see Promotions Manager requirements and restrictions. In addition, we recommend you list items at competitive prices before including them in your markdown promotions. For an extensive list of pricing recommendations, see the Growth tab in Seller Hub. There are two ways to add items to markdown promotions: Key-based promotions select items using either the listing IDs or inventory reference IDs of the items you want to promote. Note that if you use inventory reference IDs, you must specify both the inventoryReferenceId and the associated inventoryReferenceType of the item(s) you want to include the promotion. Rule-based promotions select items using a list of eBay category IDs or seller Store category IDs. Rules can further constrain items in a promotion by minimum and maximum prices, brands, and item conditions. New promotions must be created in either a DRAFT or a SCHEDULED state. Use the DRAFT state when you are initially creating a promotion and you want to be sure it's correctly configured before scheduling it to run. When you create a promotion, the promotion ID is returned in the Location response header. Use this ID to reference the promotion in subsequent requests (such as to schedule a promotion that's in a DRAFT state). Tip: Refer to Promotions Manager in the Selling Integration Guide for details and examples showing how to create and manage seller promotions. Markdown promotions are available on all eBay marketplaces. For more information, see Promotions Manager requirements and restrictions.\",\n        \"operationId\": \"createItemPriceMarkdownPromotion\",\n        \"requestBody\": {\n          \"description\": \"This type defines the fields that describe an item price markdown promotion.\",\n          \"content\": {\n            \"application/json\": {\n              \"schema\": {\n                \"description\": \"This type defines the fields that describe an item price markdown promotion.\",\n                \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/ItemPriceMarkdown\"\n              }\n            }\n          },\n          \"required\": false\n        },\n        \"responses\": {\n          \"201\": {\n            \"description\": \"Created\",\n            \"headers\": {\n              \"Location\": {\n                \"schema\": {\n                  \"type\": \"string\",\n                  \"description\": \"The \u003cb\u003elocation\u003c/b\u003e response header contains the URL to the newly created item price markdown promotion.

Discounts can be specified as either a monetary amount or a percentage off the standard sales price. This gives you the ability offer discounts such as \u0026quot;Buy 1 Get 1\u0026quot;, or \u0026quot;Buy $50, get 20% off\u0026quot;. You can also create volume pricing promotions, where the discount amount increases as the buyer increases the quantity they purchase. There are two ways to add items to a threshold promotion: Key-based promotions select items using either the listing IDs or inventory reference IDs of the items you want to promote. Note that if you use inventory reference IDs, you must specify both the inventoryReferenceId and the associated inventoryReferenceType of the item(s) you want to include the promotion. Rule-based promotions select items using a list of eBay category IDs or seller Store category IDs. Rules can further constrain items in a promotion by minimum and maximum prices, brands, and item conditions. You must create a new promotion either a DRAFT or SCHEDULED state. Use the DRAFT state when you are initially creating a promotion and you want to be sure it's correctly configured before scheduling it to run. When you create a promotion, the promotion ID is returned in the Location response header. Use this ID to reference the promotion in subsequent requests. Tip: Refer to the Selling Integration Guide for details and examples showing how to create and manage threshold promotions using the Promotions Manager.
