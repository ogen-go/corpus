This can only be used\n            when requesting the events with a `stream_type` of `admin_logs`. For any\n            other `stream_type` this value will be ignored.\n          example: 2013-12-12T10:53:43-08:00\n          in: query\n          name: created_before\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            format: date-time\n            type: string\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Events\"\n          description: |-\n            Returns a list of event objects.\n\n            Events objects are returned in pages, with each page (chunk)\n            including a list of event objects. The response includes a\n            `chunk_size` parameter indicating how many events were returned in this\n            chunk, as well as the next `stream_position` that can be\n            queried.\n        default:\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/ClientError\"\n          description: An unexpected client error.\n      summary: List user and enterprise events\n      tags:\n        - Events\n      x-box-tag: events\n    options:\n      description: |-\n        Returns a list of real-time servers that can be used for long-polling updates\n        to the [event stream](#get-events).\n\n        Long polling is the concept where a HTTP request is kept open until the\n        server sends a response, then repeating the process over and over to receive\n        updated responses.\n\n        Long polling the event stream can only be used for user events, not for\n        enterprise events.\n\n        To use long polling, first use this endpoint to retrieve a list of long poll\n        URLs. Next, make a long poll request to any of the provided URLs.\n\n        When an event occurs in monitored account a response with the value\n        `new_change` will be sent. The response contains no other details as\n        it only serves as a prompt to take further action such as sending a\n        request to the [events endpoint](#get-events) with the last known\n        `stream_position`.\n\n        After the server sends this response it closes the connection. You must now\n        repeat the long poll process to begin listening for events again.\n\n        If no events occur for a while and the connection times out you will\n        receive a response with the value `reconnect`. When you receive this response\n        you’ll make another call to this endpoint to restart the process.\n\n        If you receive no events in `retry_timeout` seconds then you will need to\n        make another request to the real-time server (one of the URLs in the response\n        for this endpoint). This might be necessary due to network errors.\n\n        Finally, if you receive a `max_retries` error when making a request to the\n        real-time server, you should start over by making a call to this endpoint\n        first.\n      operationId: options_events\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/RealtimeServers\"\n          description: |-\n            Returns a paginated array of servers that can be used\n            instead of the regular endpoints for long-polling events.\n        default:\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/ClientError\"\n          description: An unexpected client error.\n      summary: Get events long poll endpoint\n      tags:\n        - Events\n      x-box-tag: events\n  \"/file_requests/{file_request_id}\":\n    delete:\n      description: Deletes a file request permanently.\n      operationId: delete_file_requests_id\n      parameters:\n        - description: |-\n            The unique identifier that represent a file request.\n\n            The ID for any file request can be determined\n            by visiting a file request builder in the web application\n            and copying the ID from the URL.

This query is matched against item names,\n            descriptions, text content of files, and various other fields of\n            the different item types.\n\n            This parameter supports a variety of operators to further refine\n            the results returns.\n\n            * `\"\"` - by wrapping a query in double quotes only exact matches are\n              returned by the API. Exact searches do not return search matches\n              based on specific character sequences. Instead, they return\n              matches based on phrases, that is, word sequences. For example:\n              A search for `\"Blue-Box\"` may return search results including\n              the sequence `\"blue.box\"`, `\"Blue Box\"`, and `\"Blue-Box\"`;\n              any item containing the words `Blue` and `Box` consecutively, in\n              the order specified.\n            * `AND` - returns items that contain both the search terms. For\n              example, a search for `marketing AND BoxWorks` returns items\n              that have both `marketing` and `BoxWorks` within its text in any order.\n              It does not return a result that only has `BoxWorks` in its text.\n            * `OR` - returns items that contain either of the search terms. For\n              example, a search for `marketing OR BoxWorks` returns a result that\n              has either `marketing` or `BoxWorks` within its text. Using this\n              operator is not necessary as we implicitly interpret multi-word\n              queries as `OR` unless another supported boolean term is used.\n            * `NOT` - returns items that do not contain the search term provided.\n              For example, a search for `marketing AND NOT BoxWorks` returns a result\n              that has only `marketing` within its text. Results containing\n              `BoxWorks` are omitted.\n\n            Please note that we do not support lower case (that is,\n            `and`, `or`, and `not`) or mixed case (that is, `And`, `Or`, and `Not`)\n            operators.\n\n            This field is required unless the `mdfilters` parameter is defined.\n          example: sales\n          in: query\n          name: query\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: |-\n            Limits the search results to either the files that the user has\n            access to, or to files available to the entire enterprise.\n\n            The scope defaults to `user_content`, which limits the search\n            results to content that is available to the currently authenticated\n            user.\n\n            The `enterprise_content` can be requested by an admin through our\n            support channels.
