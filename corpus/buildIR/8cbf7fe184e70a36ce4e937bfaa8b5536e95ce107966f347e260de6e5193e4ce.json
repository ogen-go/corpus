Reversals and adjustments are also treated as transactions.\n  - name: Quotations\n    description: |\n      The **Quotations** APIs are used to obtain one or multiple quotes for a mobile money customer who wishes to\n      transfer money. The creation of a quote involves returning any fees that will be levied on the sending customer\n      and if the request is international, the forex rate is returned. A request is made for a quotation by the requesting\n      Service Provider in response to a customer request. The quotation is calculated and returned. If the customer is\n      satisfied with the quotation, then they can confirm and proceed with a transaction request using the **/transactions** API.\n  - name: Accounts\n    description: |\n      The **Accounts** APIs are used to support a range of operations on a financial account resource and associated resources. Types of accounts include mobile wallets, financial institution accounts and utility accounts (e.g. for electricity).\n\n      **Identifying a Target Account**\n\n      Two methods are provided for identifying an account, the single identifier method and the multiple identifiers method.\n\n      Single Identifier Method:\n\n      - In the scenario where one identifier suffices to uniquely identify an account, the following path is to be used: **/accounts/{identifierType}/{identifier}**.\n\n      Multiple Identifiers Method:\n\n      - Where a single identifier is not sufficient to identify an account, the following path is to be used: \u0026#39; **/accounts/{accountIdentifier1}@{value1}${accountIdentifier2}@{value2}${accountIdentifier3}@{value3}**\u0026#39;. The list of permitted account identifiers supported by the Mobile Money API can be found in the API documentation. As there can be multiple identifiers required to identify the target account, the path uses a \u0026#39;$\u0026#39; delimiter to separate each identifier, up to a limit of three account identifiers.\n  - name: Bills\n    description: |\n      The **Bills** API is used to return all outstanding bills associated with an account. The main purpose of the API is to\n      support Bill Presentment, i.e. presenting all applicable bills for a payer to view and select for payment. In order to\n      pay a bill, the **/bills/payments** API is used.\n  - name: Debit Mandates\n    description: |\n      The **Debit Mandates** API is used to enable a mobile money customer to provide prior approval for payments to be taken from\n      their account by the indicated payee. If the amount property is not supplied, the mandate is considered open, i.e. the\n      payee would be able to take any amount. Mandates can be created, changed and inactivated.\n  - name: Links\n    description: |\n      The **Links** API is used to establish a link between two separate accounts on the client and provider systems. The API can be used for example to link a mobile wallet account to a Microfinance Institution account or a bank account. The link object does not mandate the processes to verify and authenticate a link request - this depends upon the use case. A link needs to be associated with a mode of operation:\n\n      - pull. The link can be used by the client to debit the target account held by the provider.\n      - push. The link can be used by the client to credit the target account held by the provider.\n      - both. The link can be used for Push and Pull requests.\n  - name: Authorisation Codes\n    description: |\n      The Authorisation Codes API allows a mobile money payer or payee to generate a code which when presented to the other party, can be redeemed for an amount set by the payer or payee, depending upon the use case. Authorisation Codes are used widely in the industry across a range of use cases, including:\n\n      - ATM Codes for card-less withdrawals. A code is generated in advance by the customer and entered into the ATM to facilitate the withdrawal.\n      - Pre-authorisation codes for agent withdrawals. Depending upon the use case, this could involve the agent (payee) generating a code or the customer (payer) generating the code.\n      - Pre-authorisation codes for merchant payments. Depending upon the use case, this could involve the merchant (payee) generating a code or the customer (payer) generating the code.\n\n      Once an authorisation code has been generated, it can be presented through multiple means, including encoding into a QR code. Typically, an authorisation code will expire.\n  - name: Supporting\n    description: |\n      Supporting APIs consist of the following:\n\n      - **Heartbeat API:** Used for monitoring purposes and establishes whether the system of an API provider is in a state that enables a client to submit a request for processing within established SLAs.\n      - **Request State API** : Used to determine the state of an asynchronous request.\n      - **Responses API** : In some circumstances, the client may not have received the final representation of the resource for which it attempted to create or update. The **Responses** API allows a client to identify and retrieve the final representation of the resource assuming that the resource was created.\npaths:\n  # Transactions APIs. These support creation, modification and viewing of financial transactions in singular and bulk.\n\n  /transactions:\n    post:\n      tags:\n        - Transactions\n      summary: Create a Transaction\n      description: Provided with a valid object representation, this endpoint allows\n        for a new transaction to be created\n      operationId: transactionsPOST\n      parameters:\n        -
