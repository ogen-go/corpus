In REST APIs that return Order IDs, including the Fulfillment API, all order IDs are returned in the new format, but the \u003cstrong\u003egetShippingFulfillment\u003c/strong\u003e method will accept both the legacy and new format order ID. The new format is a non-parsable string, globally unique across all eBay marketplaces, and consistent for both single line item and multiple line item orders. These order identifiers will be automatically generated after buyer payment, and unlike in the past, instead of just being known and exposed to the seller, these unique order identifiers will also be known and used/referenced by the buyer and eBay customer support. \u003c/span\u003e\",\n            \"required\": true,\n            \"schema\": {\n              \"type\": \"string\"\n            }\n          }\n        ],\n        \"responses\": {\n          \"200\": {\n            \"description\": \"Success\",\n            \"content\": {\n              \"application/json\": {\n                \"schema\": {\n                  \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/ShippingFulfillment\"\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          },\n          \"400\": {\n            \"description\": \"Bad Request\",\n            \"x-response-codes\": {\n              \"errors\": {\n                \"32100\": {\n                  \"domain\": \"API_FULFILLMENT\",\n                  \"category\": \"REQUEST\",\n                  \"description\": \"Invalid order ID: {\u003ci\u003eorderId\u003c/i\u003e}\"\n                },\n                \"32110\": {\n                  \"domain\": \"API_FULFILLMENT\",\n                  \"category\": \"REQUEST\",\n                  \"description\": \"Invalid shipping fulfillment ID: {\u003ci\u003efulfillmentId\u003c/i\u003e}\"\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          },\n          \"404\": {\n            \"description\": \"Not Found\"\n          },\n          \"500\": {\n            \"description\": \"Internal Server Error\",\n            \"x-response-codes\": {\n              \"errors\": {\n                \"30500\": {\n                  \"domain\": \"API_FULFILLMENT\",\n                  \"category\": \"APPLICATION\",\n                  \"description\": \"System error\"\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        },\n        \"security\": [\n          {\n            \"api_auth\": [\n              \"https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.fulfillment\",\n              \"https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.fulfillment.readonly\"\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    \"/payment_dispute/{payment_dispute_id}\": {\n      \"get\": {\n        \"tags\": [\n          \"payment_dispute\"\n        ],\n        \"summary\": \"Get Payment Dispute Details\",\n        \"description\": \"This method retrieves detailed information on a specific payment dispute.
