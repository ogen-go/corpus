If you have chosen to register\n              your domain name for five (5) years, Azure will automatically\n              renew it for one (1) additional year on each and every anniversary\n              of your domain name registration so your five (5) year\n              registration period will always remain intact, and so on.&nbsp;\n              Azure will take payment from the Payment Method you have on file\n              with Azure, at Azure's then current one-year domain name\n              registration rate.</li>\\r\n\n              <li><span style=\\\"text-decoration:\n              underline;\\\">Manual Renewal</span>.&nbsp; If you have elected to\n              turn off automatic renewal and cancel the product (i.e.,\n              cancel&nbsp;the domain name registration) effective at expiration\n              of the then current term, you may nonetheless elect to manually\n              renew the domain name at anytime prior to its&nbsp;expiration\n              date&nbsp;by&nbsp;logging into&nbsp;your <a\n              href=\\\"https://www.securepaynet.net/gdshop/shopper_lookup.asp?pro\\\n              g_id=510456\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Account Manager</a>&nbsp;and\n              manually implementing the renewal or by calling customer service\n              (should you in fact want the domain name to be renewed).
