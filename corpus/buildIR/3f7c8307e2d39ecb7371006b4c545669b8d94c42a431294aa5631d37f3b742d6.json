This list and the precision and\n            the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type.\n            In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if\n            it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the\n            scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of\n            the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type\n            supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if\n            a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error\n            will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is\n            [\"NUMERIC\", \"BIGNUMERIC\"]. If (precision,scale) is: (38,9) -\u003e\n            NUMERIC; (39,9) -\u003e BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer\n            digits); (38,10) -\u003e BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional\n            digits); (76,38) -\u003e BIGNUMERIC; (77,38) -\u003e BIGNUMERIC (error if\n            value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate\n            types. The order of the types in this field is ignored.

BigQuery\n            converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first\n            byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary\n            state.

A `Policy` is a collection of\n        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`.\n        Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and\n        domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each\n        `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For\n        some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a\n        `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a\n        resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add\n        constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.\n        To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see\n        the [IAM\n        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).\n        **JSON example:** { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\":\n        \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [\n        \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\",\n        \"domain:google.com\",\n        \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, {\n        \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [\n        \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\",\n        \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\":\n        \"request.time \u003c timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\":\n        \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: -\n        user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com -\n        serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role:\n        roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -\n        user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\n        condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access\n        after Sep 2020 expression: request.time \u003c\n        timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3\n        For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM\n        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).\n      properties:\n        auditConfigs:\n          description: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.\n          items:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/AuditConfig'\n          type: array\n        bindings:\n          description: \u003e-\n            Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may specify\n            a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are\n            applied.

It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`\n            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to\n            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to\n            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the\n            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be\n            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use\n            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call\n            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to\n            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of\n            the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.\n          format: byte\n          type: string\n        version:\n          description: \u003e-\n            Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and\n            `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any\n            operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify\n            version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: *\n            Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a\n            conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role\n            binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a\n            condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If\n            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever\n            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you\n            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all\n            of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy\n            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may\n            specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which\n            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM\n            documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).\n          format: int32\n          type: integer\n      type: object\n    ProjectList:\n      properties:\n        etag:\n          description: A hash of the page of results\n          type: string\n        kind:\n          default: bigquery#projectList\n          description: The type of list.\n          type: string\n        nextPageToken:\n          description: A token to request the next page of results.\n          type: string\n        projects:\n          description: Projects to which you have at least READ access.\n          items:\n            properties:\n              friendlyName:\n                description: A descriptive name for this project.\n                type: string\n              id:\n                description: An opaque ID of this project.\n                type: string\n              kind:\n                default: bigquery#project\n                description: The resource type.\n                type: string\n              numericId:\n                description: The numeric ID of this project.\n                format: uint64\n                type: string\n              projectReference:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProjectReference'\n                description: A unique reference to this project.\n            type: object\n          type: array\n        totalItems:\n          description: The total number of projects in the list.\n          format: int32\n          type: integer\n      type: object\n    ProjectReference:\n      properties:\n        projectId:\n          description: \u003e-\n            [Required] ID of the project.

Note that this is different from the job_id. It has the\n            following properties: 1. It is case-sensitive, limited to up to 36\n            ASCII characters. A UUID is recommended. 2. Read only queries can\n            ignore this token since they are nullipotent by definition. 3. For\n            the purposes of idempotency ensured by the request_id, a request is\n            considered duplicate of another only if they have the same\n            request_id and are actually duplicates. When determining whether a\n            request is a duplicate of the previous request, all parameters in\n            the request that may affect the behavior are considered. For\n            example, query, connection_properties, query_parameters,\n            use_legacy_sql are parameters that affect the result and are\n            considered when determining whether a request is a duplicate, but\n            properties like timeout_ms don't affect the result and are thus not\n            considered. Dry run query requests are never considered duplicate of\n            another request. 4. When a duplicate mutating query request is\n            detected, it returns: a. the results of the mutation if it completes\n            successfully within the timeout. b. the running operation if it is\n            still in progress at the end of the timeout. 5. Its lifetime is\n            limited to 15 minutes. In other words, if two requests are sent with\n            the same request_id, but more than 15 minutes apart, idempotency is\n            not guaranteed.\n          type: string\n        timeoutMs:\n          description: \u003e-\n            [Optional] How long to wait for the query to complete, in\n            milliseconds, before the request times out and returns.

If the query\n            takes longer to run than the timeout value, the call returns without\n            any results and with the 'jobComplete' flag set to false. You can\n            call GetQueryResults() to wait for the query to complete and read\n            the results.
