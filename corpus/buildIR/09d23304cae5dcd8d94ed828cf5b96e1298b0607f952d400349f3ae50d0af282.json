The percentage is usually calculated as a\n                percentage of base pay, but on the ~bonus~ plan setup it is\n                possible to override the calculation basis to calculate as a\n                percentage of a set of compensation elements.\n              example: 336341779\n              x-workday-type: Numeric\n            oneTimePaymentPlan:\n              $ref: \u003e-\n                #/components/schemas/OneTimePaymentPlan\n            scheduledPaymentDate:\n              type: string\n              description: The payment date scheduled for the one-time payment request.\n              format: date\n              x-workday-type: Date\n            sendToPayroll:\n              type: boolean\n              description: \u003e-\n                This is true if you selected Send to Payroll on the ~bonus~\n                payment, future payment, or one-time payment. If false, Workday\n                Payroll doesn't process the payment.\n              example: true\n              x-workday-type: Boolean\n            descriptor:\n              type: string\n              description: A preview of the instance\n              example: Lorem ipsum dolor sit ame\n            id:\n              type: string\n              description: Id of the instance\n    EligibilityRule:\n      allOf:\n        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/INSTANCE_MODEL_REFERENCE'\n        - type: object\n    ScoreCardProfile:\n      allOf:\n        - type: object\n          properties:\n            eligibilityRule:\n              $ref: \u003e-\n                #/components/schemas/EligibilityRule\n            profileScorecardGoals:\n              type: array\n              description: The goals for the Compensation Scorecard.\n              items:\n                $ref: \u003e-\n                  #/components/schemas/ScorecardGoalSummary\n              x-workday-type: Multi-instance\n            id:\n              type: string\n              description: Id of the instance\n  securitySchemes:\n    OAuth2:\n      type: oauth2\n      flows:\n        implicit:\n          authorizationUrl: https://\u003ctenantauthorizationhostname\u003e\n          scopes: {}\n",
