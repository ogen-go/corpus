It has been deprecated and will be decommissioned\n    on 8 August 2022. We require you to switch to `v1` as soon as\n    possible.|[Click here](https://developers.voxbone.com/legacy/)|\n\n    |`v1`|Our current API, which includes number ordering, compliance,\n    configuration and inventory management to support your Voice and SMS\n    communications.|Currently viewing|\n\n    |`v2`|Our CDRs (Call Detail Records) API.|[Click\n    here](https://dev.bandwidth.com/apis/global/v2/)|\n\n    |`beta`|Early access to APIs under development including Number Whitelisting\n    and Number Porting.|[Click\n    here](https://dev.bandwidth.com/apis/global/beta/)|\n\n\n    ## Access\n\n\n    Authentication for Bandwidth's global API is done with API keys. Please\n    ensure:\n\n\n    - Your account is activated for API access. You can do so on our [Global\n    Portal](https://app.voxbone.com/home). If you have trouble, reach out to\n    your account manager or raise a support ticket.\n\n    - You've setup an API key. You can generate your API key under **Settings >\n    API**.\n\n\n    ## Environments\n\n\n    There are currently two environments for our global APIs:\n\n\n    | Environment | Base URL | Description |\n\n    | --- | --- | --- |\n\n    | Production | https://api.voxbone.com | Live production network. |\n\n    | Sandbox | https://api.sandbox.voxbone.com | Intended for simulating\n    ordering and address verification. You can test ordering without being\n    charged, service activation and more. Any API calls performed through our\n    Sandbox API can be viewed via our [Sandbox\n    Portal](https://sandbox.voxbone.com/sandbox-v3/). |\n\n\n    ## Security & Rate Limiting\n\n\n    For protecting both your apps and our systems, a __20 requests per second by\n    client IP__ is performed on your API calls. If you send more requests, your\n    requests may be rejected by an `HTTP 509 Bandwidth Limit Exceeded` or `HTTP\n    429 Too Many Requests` in the response.\n\n\n    ## Errors and Process Feedback\n\n\n    If there's an error with processing your API request, the server will return\n    an appropriate HTTP status code, along with error types and codes.\n\n\n    ### Common Error Codes\n\n\n    Standard errors related to validation of your request in terms of data and\n    field types. These would indicate a problem with your request.\n\n\n    __How to fix__: Please review the endpoint description to fix any errors.\n\n\n    |Technical Name|Error Code|Message|\n\n    |:---:|:---:|:---|\n\n    |`WRONG_DATE_FORMAT`|`10`|The date format is not correct. Please format all\n    dates in the ‘YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS’ format|\n\n    |`WRONG_PAGE_NUMBERING`|`11`|The page number must be a positive integer.|\n\n    |`WRONG_PAGE_SIZE`|`12`|The page size must be a positive integer with a\n    maximum of 5000.|\n\n    |`PAGINATION_OVERFLOW`|`13`|Pagination overflow : the given page does not\n    exist.|\n\n    |`ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT`|`14`|Illegal value.|\n\n    |`NOT_FOUND`|`15`|Not Found.|\n\n    |`FIELD_REQUIRED`|`16`|A required field is missing.|\n\n    |`ILLEGAL_NUMBER_VALUE`|`17`|Illegal value for a numeric field.|\n\n    |`ILLEGAL_BOOLEAN_VALUE`|`18`|Illegal value for a boolean field.|\n\n    |`ILLEGAL_DATE_VALUE`|`19`|Illegal value for a date field.|\n\n    |`ILLEGAL_VALUE_JSON`|`20`|The system can not process this value.

Your request is\n    missing a body. Sandbox users: this can also occur when the Sandbox\n    environment is down.|\n\n\n    ### Service Activation Error Codes\n\n\n    Errors in the API workflows related to regulations. These would indicate\n    something missing or not allowed for your request.\n\n\n    __How to fix__: Review regulatory requirements for the service activation in\n    your request (i.e. address requirements on the country, number type, etc.).\n    Common fixes include formatting/absence of `extraFields`\n\n\n    |Technical Name|Error Code|Message|\n\n    |:---:|:---:|:---|\n\n    |`FIELD_MISSING`|`500`|Missing field.|\n\n    |`FIELD_SIZE`|`501`|Maximum field size exceeded.|\n\n    |`EXTRA_FIELD_UNEXISTENT`|`502`|The address extra field does not exist for\n    the country.|\n\n    |`FIELD_INVALID`|`503`|The field value is not correct.|\n\n    |`EXTRA_FIELD_INVALID`|`504`|The extra field value is not correct.|\n\n    |`TEMPLATE_COUNTRY_INVALID`|`505`|The country of the address should be the\n    same as the destination country for the selected didType.|\n\n    |`EXTRA_FIELDS_NOT_ACCEPTED`|`506`|Extra fields are not accepted for the\n    destination country and did_type.|\n\n    |`INVALID_REGULATION_ADDRESS`|`507`|The regulation address id is not valid,\n    either it does not exist or the regulation address does not belong to you.\n    Invalid regulation address:|\n\n    |`LINKED_REGULATION_ADDRESS`|`508`|Error during deletion, the regulation\n    address is linked to one or more DID.

Its verification has already been requested, therefore it will\n    be possible to link dids as soon as it is confirmed.|\n\n    |`MULTIPLE_DIDGROUPS`|`513`|All the DID must belong to the same didgroup.|\n\n    |`DID_ALREADY_LINKED`|`514`|The DID is already linked. Please unlink it\n    before trying to link it to a new address.|\n\n    |`REJECTED_REGULATION_ADDRESS`|`515`|The proof of address has been\n    rejected.|\n\n    |`INVALID_DID_LIST`|`516`|Invalid DID id.|\n\n    |`VERIFICATION_NOT_YET_REQUESTED`|`517`|No request for verification was sent\n    for this regulation address.

A rejection reason means a change in\n    the address information or the proof documents is necessary to proceed with\n    service activation. If you have any disputes or confusion about what to do\n    next, feel free to contact our [Customer Success Team via\n    email](mailto:compliance@bandwidth.com).\n\n\n    In December 2020 we made some changes to end user documentation validation,\n    resulting in our rejection reasons changing slightly in order to provide you\n    with more clarity.

It is designed to accommodate use cases where you\n      have your own customer portal in which you're selling numbers and capacity\n      through Bandwidth.\n\n      The Ordering module contains 10 methods that allow purchasing our\n      services. To buy services, your account balance should have sufficient\n      funds in your \"Business Account\". If you are using the API to buy services\n      on behalf of your end users, it's recommended to configure auto-refill of\n      funds on your account. This can be done on our portal under Payment\n      Settings.\n\n\n      A typical API call flow for a purchase would include the following steps:\n\n      1. createCart will return a cartIdentifier (listCart as well if you’ve\n      already got an existing cart)\n\n      2. To buy numbers, get the associated didGroupId for a country/area code\n      from listDidGroup method (Inventory module)\n\n      3. Add a certain quantity of DIDs (didCartItem) from a didGroupId to the\n      CartIdentifier using addToCart\n\n      4. Check your funds with accountBalance\n\n      5. Make sure that the cart value (setup100 + monthly100 will be charged)\n      is not higher than your account Balance. If not, add funds via our portal.\n\n      6. Re-iterate the last 3 operations until you wish to check-out your cart\n      using checkoutCart. Once checkoutCart method is called on a cart, an\n      associated order will be created.\n\n      7. Use the listOrder method to retrieve your orders and their status\n      (carts can lead to 1 or multiple order(s)). When running the checkoutCart\n      operation, the response contains a list of productCheckout elements. These\n      elements give you an orderReference for each product type contained in\n      your cart, which can be used as a filter for the listDid operation\n  - name: Service Activation\n    description: >\n      Service activation module contains a list of operations that allow you to\n      manage regulatory information on numbers and services for activation.\n      Every country has specific restrictions and activation requirements for\n      different services. A number from a country which has regulation\n      requirements will not be activated for voice services unless a set of\n      validated address and end user details are associated with it.\n\n\n      The main activation information that's needed are addresses and end user\n      information, which we call \"Local Address Requirements\" or in short, LAR.\n\n\n      LAR needs for a specific country and area code can be retrieved via\n      [`/inventory/didGroup`](https://dev.bandwidth.com/apis/global/#tag/Service-and-Coverage/operation/listDidGroup)\n      with associated filter parameters for a country and area code. In the\n      response, you can see what type of an address is required and if proof\n      document needs to be attached.\n\n\n      Keep in mind that there can be more specific requirements for the country\n      you're trying to activate voice services from. Please review our __[Guide\n      to using our LAR\n      API](https://support.voxbone.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402904174097)__ which\n      provides detailed country-specific regulatory requirements\n\n\n      Depending on the country and number type, a proof of address and/or proof\n      of identity may be required. If this is the case, an address must be\n      linked with one or both of these documents which will be verified by\n      Bandwidth.\n\n        - __Valid address__: this is an address that contains all the data requested by the local regulator. Our systems can automatically check the validity of an address:\n            - Additional mandatory information can be required in certain countries or for certain number types. Please refer to our __[Guide to using our LAR API](https://support.voxbone.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402904174097)__ for more information.\n            - A check is sometimes done on the zip code to verify that the number is in the same local area as the number\n\n        - __Verified address__: this is an address which requires a proof of address and for which a Bandwidth employee will manually check that the documents that have been submitted are the expected ones (e.g. correct type of document, correct address, etc.). The verification process can take up to 2 working days. Accepted documents are usually:\n            - A recurring utility bill with Company/Customer name and address which is not older than 6 months\n            - A government or state provided ID like passport, driver’s license or a letter from the government verifying the customer’s address.\n\n      In the most complex cases (e.g. Germany), your geographic DIDs will have\n      to be linked to a valid and verified address and the address will have to\n      be local to the DID’s area code. An example of a possible call flow to\n      implement Local Address Requirements could be the following (based on\n      geographic German DID:\n\n        - [`listDidGroup` with the `didGroupId`](https://dev.bandwidth.com/apis/global/#tag/Service-and-Coverage/operation/listDidGroup) of the purchased number will show `proofRequired` = `true` and `addressType` = `LOCAL`\n        - If you have an existing address, you may use [`isAddressValid`](https://dev.bandwidth.com/apis/global/#tag/Service-Activation/operation/isAddressValid) or directly try to [link it to the DID using `linkRegulationAddress`](https://dev.bandwidth.com/apis/global/#tag/Service-Activation/operation/linkRegulationAddress), an error message will be returned indicating if there is any missing data.\n        - Because for Germany the `addressType` is `LOCAL`, you have to use [`listZipCodes`](https://dev.bandwidth.com/apis/global/#tag/Service-Activation/operation/listZipCodes) to make sure that a valid zip code is used for the number’s area code. Otherwise the linkRegulationAddress will return an error even if the address is verified.\n        - If there is no existing address, use the [`createRegulationAddress`](https://dev.bandwidth.com/apis/global/#tag/Service-Activation/operation/createRegulationAddress). Note that depending on the country of the DID (`destinationCountryCodeA3`) and its type (`didType`), the required data will differ.\n        - Upload a proof of address. There are two different methods to upload a proof of address. You can upload a proof of address for an existing address using [`uploadProofOfAddress`](https://dev.bandwidth.com/apis/global/#tag/Service-Activation/operation/uploadProofOfAddress) (only if the address is in status `REJECTED` or `NOT VERIFIED`), or you can specify the `proofOfAddress` field in the [`createRegulationAddress`](https://dev.bandwidth.com/apis/global/#tag/Service-Activation/operation/createRegulationAddress). The method will return an error if you try to upload an address proof for an address that is either `VERIFIED` or `VERIFICATION_NOT_REQUIRED` status.\n        - You can use [`listRegulationAddress`](https://dev.bandwidth.com/apis/global/#tag/Service-Activation/operation/listRegulationAddress) to check the status of your address, if the status is `VERIFIED` or `VERIFICATION_NOT_REQUIRED`, then [`linkRegulationAddress`](https://dev.bandwidth.com/apis/global/#tag/Service-Activation/operation/linkRegulationAddress) can link the DID to the address and unblock the number.\n        - An address can be unlinked from a DID by using the same [`linkRegulationAddress`](https://dev.bandwidth.com/apis/global/#tag/Service-Activation/operation/listRegulationAddress) method, and an unlinked address can be deleted by using [`deleteRegulationAddress`](https://dev.bandwidth.com/apis/global/#tag/Service-Activation/operation/deleteRegulationAddress).\n  - name: Inventory\n    description: >-\n      List, filter and retrieve information about numbers assigned to your\n      account, or cancel them if needed.\n  - name: Voice\n    description: |\n      ## Overview\n\n        Manage voice interoperability between Bandwidth and your communications platform. You can connect our numbers to your platform via Voice URIs.\n\n        After creation, Voice URIs can be linked to your numbers using the apply configuration method.\n\n        Each uri can also have a backup uri, which will be used in a failover scenario where for some reason we weren't able to connect the call to the URI specified in the \"uri\" parameter. In this case, Bandwidth would blacklist the primary uri for 5 minutes and keep connecting incoming calls to numbers linked to this uri to the specified backup URI linked to the number recursively.\n  - name: SMS\n    description: >\n      Using Bandwidth to build applications or deliver SMS for your VoxSMS\n      enabled numbers has never been easier. Once you have your VoxSMS enabled\n      numbers, you will need to create at least one SMS Link Group containing an\n      SMS Link.\n\n\n      An SMS Link is an entity that defines the direction of the SMS connection,\n      the protocol type, and the connection details. SMS Link Group is simply an\n      entity that contains one or several SMS Links.\n\n\n      You will also need to enable outbound SMS and link your DID to an SMS Link\n      Group from the Number Configuration section.\n\n\n      __Sending / Receiving an SMS__:\n\n\n      To be able to send or receive an SMS via Voxbone SMS API please use the\n      [following guide](https://developers.voxbone.com/sms/).\n\n\n      __IMPORTANT__:\n\n\n      For outbound or bi-directional links, the only supported protocols are\n      SMPP and REST JSON. For SMPP you can choose to set up your connection as\n      SMPP (ESME) or SMPP (SMSC).\n\n      - If you would like Bandwidth to connect to your equipment, then select\n      SMPP (ESME).\n\n      - If you are using your own SMPP server, then select SMPP (SMSC).\n\n\n      For inbound links you need to choose the protocol (SMPP, SIP and SMTP) and\n      the traffic direction (i.e. From Bandwidth).\n  - name: Fax\n    description: Manage Fax configuration\n  - name: Capacity\n    description: >\n      ## Overview\n\n\n      Capacity groups helps you manage and monitor channel usage across a group\n      of numbers.\n\n      If you have multiple data centres and/or contact centres that handles your\n      inbound calls, you can use the API to create capacity groups for each,\n      configure alert thresholds for each to get notified when your usage is\n      reaching its limit.\n\n      After creation, capacity groups can be assigned to numbers by using the\n      Apply Configuration method.\n  - name: Connectivity\n    description: >-\n      Retrieve details about Bandwidth's data centres and network interconnect\n      for various services such as call termination, speech analytics, etc.\n  - name: Number Configuration\n    description: >-\n      The Configuration module allows you to apply various configuration\n      settings to the DID’s within your inventory.
