These have \\\"TODO\\\" as the description, and are automatically removed before document generation. If you are viewing the \\\"Trimmed\\\" version of this document, they have been removed for brevity.\\r\\n\\r\\n## API Object Organization\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Users** and **Creators** exist on Floatplane at the highest level\\r\\n\\t- The highest-level object in Floatplane is the Creator. This is an entity, such as Linus Tech Tips, that produces media for Users.\\r\\n- A Creator owns one or more **Subscription Plans**\\r\\n- A User can view a Creator's Content if they are subscribed to them\\r\\n- A Creator publishes **Content**, in the form of **Blog Posts**\\r\\n\\t- Content is produced by Creators, and show up for subscribed Users to view when it is released. A piece of Content is meant to be generic, and may contain different types of sub-Content. Currently, the only type is a Blog Post.\\r\\n\\t- A Blog Post is the main type of Content that a Creator produces. Blog Posts are how a Creator can share text and/or media attachments with their subscribers.\\r\\n- A Blog Post is comprised of one or more of: video, audio, picture, or gallery **Attachments**\\r\\n\\t- A media Attachment may be: video, audio, picture, gallery. Attachments are a part of Blog Posts, and are in a particular order.\\r\\n- A Creator may also have a single **Livestream**\\r\\n\\r\\n## API Flow\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of Floatplane version 3.5.1, these are the recommended endpoints to use for normal operations.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Login\\r\\n\\t1. `/api/v3/auth/captcha/info` - Get captcha information\\r\\n\\t1. `/api/v2/auth/login` - Login with username, password, and optional captcha token\\r\\n\\t1. `/api/v2/auth/checkFor2faLogin` - Optionally provide 2FA token to complete login\\r\\n\\t1. `/api/v2/auth/logout` - Logout at a later point in time\\r\\n1. Home page\\r\\n\\t1. `/api/v3/user/subscriptions` - Get the user's active subscriptions\\r\\n\\t1. `/api/v3/content/creator/list` - Using the subscriptions, show a home page with content from all subscriptions\\r\\n\\t\\t1. Supply all creator identifiers from the subscriptions\\r\\n\\t\\t1. This should be paginated\\r\\n\\t1. `/api/v2/creator/info` - Also show a list of creators that the user can select\\r\\n\\t\\t1. Note that this can search and return multiple creators. The V3 version only works for a single creator at a time.\\r\\n1. Creator page\\r\\n\\t1. `/api/v3/creator/info` - Get more details for the creator to display, including if livestreams are available\\r\\n\\t1. `/api/v3/content/creator` - Show recent content by the creator\\r\\n\\t1. `/api/v2/plan/info` - Show available plans the user can subscribe to for the creator\\r\\n1. Content page\\r\\n\\t1. `/api/v3/content/post` - Show more detailed information about a piece of content, including text description, available attachments, metadata, interactions, etc.\\r\\n\\t1. `/api/v3/content/related` - List some related content for the user to watch next\\r\\n\\t1. `/api/v3/comment` - Load comments for the content for the user to read\\r\\n\\t\\t1. There are several more comment APIs to post, like, dislike, etc.\\r\\n\\t1. `/api/v2/user/ban/status` - Determine if the user is banned from this creator\\r\\n\\t1. `/api/v3/content/{video|audio|picture|gallery}` - Load the attached media for the post. This is usually video, but audio, pictures, and galleries are also available.\\r\\n\\t1. `/api/v2/cdn/delivery` - For video and audio, this is required to get the information to stream or download the content in media players\\r\\n1. Livestream\\r\\n\\t1. `/api/v2/cdn/delivery` - Using the type \\\"livestream\\\" to load the livestream media in a media player\\r\\n\\t1. `wss://chat.floatplane.com/sails.io/?...` - To connect to the livestream chat over websocket. TODO: Map out the WebSocket API.\\r\\n1. User Profile\\r\\n\\t1. `/api/v3/user/self` - Display username, name, email, and profile pictures\\r\\n\\r\\n## API Organization\\r\\n\\r\\nThe organization of APIs into categories in this document are reflected from the internal organization of the Floatplane website bundled code, from `frontend.floatplane.com/{version}/vendor.js`. This is in order to use the best organization from the original developers' point of view.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor instance, Floatplane's authentication endpoints are organized into `Auth.v2.login(...)`, `Auth.v2.logout()`, and `Auth.v3.getCaptchaInfo()`. A limitation in OpenAPI is the lack of nested tagging/structure, so this document splits `Auth` into `AuthV2` and `AuthV3` to emulate the nested structure.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Notes\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that the Floatplane API does support the use of [ETags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag) for retrieving some information, such as retrieving information about creators, users, etc. Expect an HTTP 304 if the content has not changed, and to re-use cached responses. This is useful to ease the strain on Floatplane's API server.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe date-time format used by Floatplane API is not standard ISO 8601 format. The dates/times given by Floatplane include milliseconds. Depending on your code generator, you may need to override the date-time format to something similar to `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ`, for both encoding and decoding.\",\n        \"license\": {\n            \"name\": \"MIT\",\n            \"url\": \"https://github.com/Jman012/FloatplaneAPI/blob/main/LICENSE\"\n        },\n        \"contact\": {\n            \"name\": \"James Linnell\",\n            \"url\": \"https://github.com/Jman012/FloatplaneAPI/\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"servers\": [\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://www.floatplane.com\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"tags\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"AuthV2\",\n            \"description\": \"Sign up, login, 2FA, and logout.
