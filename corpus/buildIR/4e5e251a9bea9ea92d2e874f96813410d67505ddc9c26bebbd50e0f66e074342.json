Control servers utilize two general\n                        architectures: client-server and peer-to-peer. In a\n                        client-server model, all the hosts are controlled by a\n                        single server or a few control servers. In a\n                        peer-to-peer model, the infected hosts are both clients\n                        and servers, and they control other hosts so that\n                        instead of isolating the few control servers, all the\n                        hosts need to be removed.\"\n                      threatName: rarog\n                      threatType: C2\n                  type: ip\n              extendedProperties:\n                attacker IP: 192.0.2.1\n                domain Name: Contoso\n                resourceType: Virtual Machine\n                user Name: administrator\n              instanceId: f144ee95-a3e5-42da-a279-967d115809aa\n              isIncident: false\n              remediationSteps: \"verify that the user invoked this process\\r\n\n                run antimalware scan of the VM\"\n              reportedSeverity: High\n              reportedTimeUtc: 2018-05-02T05:36:12.2089889Z\n              state: Dismissed\n              subscriptionId: 20ff7fc3-e762-44dd-bd96-b71116dcdc23\n              vendorName: Microsoft\n            type: Microsoft.Security/Locations/alerts\n    Get_security_alert_on_a_resource_group_from_a_security_data_location:\n      value:\n        id: /subscriptions/20ff7fc3-e762-44dd-bd96-b71116dcdc23/resourceGroups/myRg1/providers/Microsoft.Security/locations/westeurope/alerts/2518770965529163669_F144EE95-A3E5-42DA-A279-967D115809AA\n        name: 2518770965529163669_F144EE95-A3E5-42DA-A279-967D115809AA\n        properties:\n          actionTaken: Detected\n          alertDisplayName: Threat Intelligence Alert\n          alertName: ThreatIntelligence\n          associatedResource: /subscriptions/20ff7fc3-e762-44dd-bd96-b71116dcdc23/resourceGroups/myRg1/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/vm1\n          canBeInvestigated: true\n          compromisedEntity: vm1\n          confidenceReasons:\n            - reason: Some user reason\n              type: User\n            - reason: Some proccess reason\n              type: Process\n            - reason: Some computer reason\n              type: Computer\n          confidenceScore: 0.8\n          correlationKey: Rkso6LFWxzCll5tqrk4hnrBJ+MY1BX806W6q6+0s9Jk=\n          description: Process was detected running on the host and is considered to be\n            suspicious, verify that the user run it\n          detectedTimeUtc: 2018-05-01T19:50:47.083633Z\n          entities:\n            - address: 192.0.2.1\n              location:\n                asn: 6584\n                city: sonning\n                countryCode: gb\n                latitude: 51.468\n                longitude: -0.909\n                state: wokingham\n              threatIntelligence:\n                - confidence: 0.8\n                  providerName: Team Cymru\n                  reportLink: http://www.microsoft.com\n                  threatDescription: \"In bot armies, the controller is the server machine(s) that\n                    gives instructions to the controlled (zombied) hosts that\n                    connect to the command and control (C2) network. The\n                    controller host is usually running a botnet management\n                    application that is sending the commands to the zombied\n                    members of the bot army. These commands include, but are not\n                    limited to, the following: updating bitcoin wallet\n                    information, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) target\n                    listings, updated C2 communication contact lists, and\n                    targeting data. C2 servers may be either directly controlled\n                    by the malware operators or run on hardware compromised by\n                    malware.
