You can also use the \"Authorize\" button and insert your preferred authentication method.\n    For basic authentication simply use your SCM-Manager credentials. If you want to use the bearer token authentication, you can generate an\n    valid token using the authentication endpoint and copy the response body.\n\n    SCM-Manager defines a modern [\"Level 3\"-REST API](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html).\n    Using the HATEOAS architecture for REST allows us to provide discoverable and self explanatory endpoint definitions.\n    The responses are build using the [HAL JSON format](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html).\n    HAL makes the API human-friendly and simplifies the communication between the frontend and the server using links and embedded resources.\n\n    We highly suggest using HAL links when creating new functions for SCM-Manager since they are consistent and are only\n    appended to the response when user has the necessary permissions. The links and embedded resources can also be used by plugins, which can\n    define new resources or enrich existing ones.\n  contact:\n    name: SCM-Manager\n    url: https://scm-manager.org\n    email: scmmanager@googlegroups.com\n  license:\n    name: MIT\n    url: https://github.com/scm-manager/scm-manager/blob/develop/LICENSE.txt\n  version: ${version}\nservers:\n  - url: http://localhost:8081/scm/api\n    description: local endpoint url\n",
