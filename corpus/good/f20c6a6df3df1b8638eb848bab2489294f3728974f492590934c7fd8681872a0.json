Setting this parameter to `true`\n          allows to forward collected HTTP requests via HTTPS protocol even if the forward end-point is configured with\n          self-signed TLS/SSL certificate. **Warning:** enabling this feature has known security implications.\n          * `expand_path` changes the logic of constructing taget URL when forwarding requests. If this parameter is\n          set to `true` the forward URL path will be expanded when original HTTP request contains compound path. For\n          example, a basket with name **server1** is configured to forward all requests to `http://server1.intranet:8001/myservice`\n          and it has received an HTTP request like `GET http://baskets.example.com/server1/component/123/events?status=OK`\n          then depending on `expand_path` settings the request will be forwarded to:\n            * `true` =\u003e `GET http://server1.intranet:8001/myservice/component/123/events?status=OK`\n            * `false` =\u003e `GET http://server1.intranet:8001/myservice?status=OK`\n      parameters:\n        - description: The basket name\n          in: path\n          name: name\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n      requestBody:\n        $ref: \"#/components/requestBodies/Config\"\n      responses:\n        \"204\":\n          description: No Content.

Setting this parameter to `true`\n          allows to forward collected HTTP requests via HTTPS protocol even if the forward end-point is configured with\n          self-signed TLS/SSL certificate. **Warning:** enabling this feature has known security implications.\n          * `expand_path` changes the logic of constructing taget URL when forwarding requests. If this parameter is\n          set to `true` the forward URL path will be expanded when original HTTP request contains compound path. For\n          example, a basket with name **server1** is configured to forward all requests to `http://server1.intranet:8001/myservice`\n          and it has received an HTTP request like `GET http://baskets.example.com/server1/component/123/events?status=OK`\n          then depending on `expand_path` settings the request will be forwarded to:\n            * `true` =\u003e `GET http://server1.intranet:8001/myservice/component/123/events?status=OK`\n            * `false` =\u003e `GET http://server1.intranet:8001/myservice?status=OK`\n      parameters:\n        - description: The basket name\n          in: path\n          name: name\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n      requestBody:\n        $ref: \"#/components/requestBodies/Config\"\n      responses:\n        \"204\":\n          description: No Content.
