You can also get access to past messages and see your account profile.\n\n    The base URL to use for this service is `https://api.bulksms.com/v1`.  The base URL cannot be used on its own; you must append a path that identifies an operation and you may have to specify some path parameters as well.\n\n    [Click here](/developer/) to go to the main BulkSMS developer site.\n\n    In order to give you an idea on how the API can be used, some JSON snippets are provided below.  Have a look at the [messages section](#tag/Message) for more information.\n\n    Probably the most simple example\n\n    ```\n    {\n        \"to\": \"+27001234567\",\n        \"body\": \"Hello World!\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n\n    You can send unicode automatically using the `auto-unicode` query parameter. \n    Alternatively, you can specify `UNICODE` for the `encoding` property in the request body. \n    Please note: when `auto-unicode` is specified and the value of the `encoding` property is `UNICODE`, the message will always be sent as `UNICODE`.\n\n    Here is an example that sets the `encoding` explicitly\n\n    ```\n    {\n      \"to\": \"+27001234567\",\n      \"body\": \"Dobrá práce! Jak se máš?\",\n      \"encoding\": \"UNICODE\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n    You can also specify a from number\n\n    ```\n    {\n        \"from\": \"+27007654321\",\n        \"to\": \"+27001234567\",\n        \"body\": \"Hello World!\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Similar to above, but repliable\n\n    ```\n    {\n        \"from\": { \"type\": \"REPLIABLE\" },\n        \"to\": \"+27001234567\",\n        \"body\": \"Hello World!\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n    A message to a group called Everyone\n\n    ```\n    {\n        \"to\": { \"type\": \"GROUP\", \"name\": \"Everyone\" },\n        \"body\": \"Hello World!\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n    A message to multiple recipients\n\n    ```\n    {\n        \"to\": [\"+27001234567\", \"+27002345678\", \"+27003456789\"],\n        \"body\": \"Happy Holidays!\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Sending more than one message in the same request\n\n    ```\n    [\n        {\n            \"to\": \"+27001234567\",\n            \"body\": \"Hello World!\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"to\": \"+27002345678\",\n            \"body\": \"Hello Universe!\"\n        }\n    ]\n    ```\n\n    **The insecure base URL `http://api.bulksms.com/v1` is deprecated** and may in future result in a `301` redirect response, or insecure requests may be rejected outright. Please use the secure (`https`) URI above.\n\n    ### HTTP Content Type\n\n    All API methods expect requests to supply a `Content-Type` header with the value `application/json`. All responses will have the `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.\n\n    ### JSON Formatting\n\n    You are advised to format your JSON resources according to strict JSON format rules. While the API does attempt to parse strictly invalid JSON documents, doing so may lead to incorrect interpretation and unexpected results.\n\n    Good JSON libraries will produce valid JSON suitable for submission, but if you are manually generating the JSON text, be careful to follow the JSON format. This include correct escaping of control characters and double quoting of property names.\n\n    See the [JSON specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627) for further information.\n\n    ### Date Formatting\n\n    Dates are formatted according to ISO-8601, such as `1970-01-01T10:00:00+01:00` for 1st January 1970, 10AM UTC+1.\n\n    See the [Wikipedia ISO 8601 reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) for further information.\n\n    Specifically, calendar dates are formatted with the 'extended' format `YYYY-MM-DD`. Basic format, week dates and ordinal dates are not supported. Times are also formatted in the 'extended' format `hh:mm:ss`. Hours, minutes and seconds are mandatory. Offset from UTC must be provided; this is to ensure that there is no misunderstanding regarding times provided to the API.\n\n    The format we look for is `yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss[Z|[+-]hh:mm]`\n\n    Examples of valid date/times are`2011-12-31T12:00:00Z` `2011-12-31T12:00:00+02:00`\n\n    ### Entity Format Modifications\n\n    It is expected that over time some changes will be made to the request and response formats of various methods available in the API.\n    Where possible, these will be implemented in a backwards compatible way.\n    To make this possible you are required to ignore unknown properties.\n    This enables the addition of information in response documents while maintaining compatibility with older clients.\n\n    ### Optional Request Entity Properties\n\n    There are many instances where requests can be made without having to specify every single property allowable in the request format.\n    Any such optional properties are noted as such in the documentation and their default value is noted.\n  title: BulkSMS JSON REST API\n  version: 1.0.0\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    - telecom\n  x-logo:\n    url: /developer/images/bulksms.png\n  x-origin:\n    - format: openapi\n      url: http://developer.bulksms.com/json/v1/swagger.yaml\n      version: \"3.0\"\n  x-providerName: bulksms.com\nsecurity:\n  - basicAuth: []\ntags:\n  - name: Message\n    x-displayName: Messages\n  - name: Profile\n    x-displayName: Profile\npaths:\n  /blocked-numbers:\n    get:\n      parameters:\n        - description: Records with an `id` that is greater or equal to min-id will be returned.

Messages sent to blocked numbers are billed to your account.\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              items:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/PhoneNumber\"\n              type: array\n        description: \"Maximum size: `1000` items\"\n        required: true\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: Empty body upon success\n      security:\n        - basicAuth: []\n      summary: Create a blocked number\n      tags:\n        - Blocked Numbers\n  /messages:\n    get:\n      description: |\n        Retrieve the messages you have sent or received.\n\n        All the parameters are optional.  If a value is not supplied for `filter`, the messages are not filtered.\n\n        Messages can be filtered by supplying query clauses in the `filter` parameter. Each clause has the form `name=value` where `name` is the name of a filter field and `value` is a valid value for that field.  A value for a field is optional. Include a clause for a field in the filter only when there is a need to fetch messages that match some value for that field.\n        For a numeric filter field, you can also use the less than operator (`\u003c`).\n\n        If present, the filter value must have at least one clause, but it can contain a combination of clauses. Multiple clauses are separated with the `\u0026` symbol.  Semantically, multiple clauses form a [logical conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction).\n\n        For example, if you want to list all messages that were sent as part of a particular submission, your filter contains two clauses and will look something like this\n        ```\n        type%3DSENT\u0026submission.id%3D1-00000000000522347562\n        ```\n        Because `filter` is a request parameter, it is important to note that the value for this parameter must be *URL encoded*. In particular, the `=` encodes to `%3D` and the `\u0026` encodes to `%26`.  Note that you do not have to encode the `\u003c` character.\n\n        Using the previous example to illustrate; after encoding and encasing it, the clauses are transformed into a request that looks like this\n        ```\n        GET /v1/messages?filter=type%3DSENT%26submission.id%3D1-00000000000522347562\n        ```\n        If the field name or the field value of a clause is not valid, a [bad_request error](errors#bad-request) is returned instead of the usual result.  The `detail` field of this error provides more information about the problem.\n\n        The table below lists the fields available for filtering\n\n        | Field | Type   | Values | Note and example |\n        |-------|------|--------------------|------|\n        | id            | Integer  | Positive integer  | Use the `id` field with `\u003c` (or with `\u003e`) to fetch messages that are older (or newer) than those that are already fetched. \u003cbr/\u003e`filter=id\u003c123456` |\n        | type          | String  | SENT, RECEIVED  | SENT are Mobile Terminating (MT) SMSs; RECEIVED are Mobile Originating (MO) SMSs.\u003cbr/\u003e`filter=type%3DSENT` |\n        | submission.id | String  |  | `filter=submission.id%3D1-00000000000522347562` |\n        | status.type   | String  | ACCEPTED, SCHEDULED, SENT, DELIVERED, FAILED  | See the message `status.type` field for more information. \u003cbr/\u003e`filter=status.type%3DDELIVERED` |\n        | status.id| String  |  | See the message `status.id` field for more information. `filter=status.id%3DFAILED.EXPIRED`|\n        | submission.date | String | Formatted Date | A fully specified date (e.g. 2017-01-01T10:00:00+01:00).

The default is 1000.\n            The value of `limit` is not a guarantee that a specific number of messages will be in the response, even if there are more messages available.  Consider the case where you have 150 messages and you specify `limit=50`.  It is possible that only 49 messages will be returned.  The  way to make sure that there are no more messages is to submit a new call using the `id` filter field with the `\u003c` operator (described below).\n          in: query\n          name: limit\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            format: int\n            type: number\n        - description: See the message filtering for more information.\n          in: query\n          name: filter\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: |\n            The default value is DESCENDING\n\n            If the `sortOrder` is DESCENDING, the newest messages be first in the result.

Fields are identified by a zero based index; the first field is `F0`, the second is `F1` and so on.  \n\n        For example, let's say you want to send a daily SMS message to all your clients that tell them what their current balance is.  The `body` of the message could look something like this \n\n        ```\n        Good morning {F0######}, your balance is {F1######}\n        ```\n\n        In this message, the first field, `F0`, is the name  of the customer and he second field `F1` is the balance for that customer.  The `#` used to specify the maximum length  of the field.  Note that the maximum length allowed for the value includes the space taken by the braces, template name and hash symbol.  For example, the value `{F0#}` specifies a maximum length of `5`.  If the data is longer than this length, the data will be truncated when the message body is constructed.\n\n        The data fields are provided in the property named `fields` in the `to` element.  Here is a complete example of how this might look\n\n        ```\n        {\n          \"body\": \"Good morning {F0######}, your balance is {F1######}\",\n          \"to\":  [\n              {\"address\": \"27456789\",\"fields\": [\"Harry\", \"$1345.23\"] },\n              {\"address\": \"27456785\",\"fields\": [\"Sally\", \"$2345.58\"] }\n          ]\n        }\n        ```\n\n        If you are sending to contacts (or to groups) in your phonebook, you can use the *Phonebook based templates*.  These are similar to the templates described above, but they have specific names. The template for the contact's first name is identified by `fn` and the template for the contact's surname is identified by `sn`.  Below in an example that will work if the numbers are registered in your phonebook. \n\n        ```\n        {\n          \"body\": \"Hi {fn######} {sn######}, have a great day!\",\n          \"to\":  [\n              {\"address\": \"27456789\" },\n              {\"address\": \"27456785\" }\n          ]\n        }\n        ```\n      parameters:\n        - description: |\n            Safeguards against the possibility of sending the same messages more than once.\n\n            If a communication failure occurs during a submission, you cannot be sure that the submission was processed; therefore you would have to submit it again. When you post the retry, you must use the `deduplication-id` of the original post. The BulkSMS system uses this ID to check that the request was not previously processed. (If it was previously processed, the submission will succeed, and the behaviour will be indistinguishable to you from a non-duplicated submission). The ID expires after about 12 hours.\n          in: query\n          name: deduplication-id\n          schema:\n            format: int32\n            type: integer\n        - description: |\n            Specifies how to deal with message text that contains characters not present in the GSM 03.38 character set.\n\n            Messages that contain only GSM 03.38 characters are not affected by this setting. \n            If the value is `true` then a message containing non-GSM 03.38 characters will be transmitted as a Unicode SMS (which is most likely more costly). \n\n            Please note: when `auto-unicode` is `true` and the value of the `encoding` property is specified as `UNICODE`, the message will always be sent as `UNICODE`.\n\n            If the value is `false` and the `encoding` property is `TEXT` then non-GSM 03.38 characters will be replaced by the `?` character.\n\n            When using this setting on the API, you should take case to ensure that your message is _clean_.  \n\n            Invisible unicode and unexpected characters could unintentionally convert an message to `UNICODE`.

This is the most flexible and the simplest solution.\n\n        However, if it is not possible to use your web server, you can use BulkSMS storage to keep the files that you want to attach to your SMS message.  Please note that these files will be deleted after 30 days.   \n\n        The process to use the BulkSMS storage requires you to take three steps:\n\n        **Step 1**: Use your BulkSMS credentials (or your API Token) to request a pre-signed URL.  This is what this `pre-sign-attachment` method is for.  It returns a PreSignInfo object that you will use in the other two steps.\n\n        **Step 2**: Upload the file using a standard HTTP `PUT` request. For your `PUT` request, use the value of `putURL` from the PreSignInfo object as the request address.  You also have to add the entries from the `fields` property (of the PreSignInfo object) to the headers of your 'PUT' request. You send the file content as the body of the `PUT` request.\n\n        **Step 3**: Now you can use the value of `fetchURL` from the PreSignInfo object in the body of your SMS messages and send those using the usual messaging API (described elsewhere in this document).  If you send the same file to many recipients, it is safe to use the same URL for all of them.\n\n        If you need to, take a closer look at the example program (on the right-hand side) to get a better idea of how to implement this process.\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: \"#/components/schemas/PreSignRequest\"\n

Webhooks\n    post:\n      description: |\n        A webhook is an URL that you can register when you want the BulkSMS system to notify you about your messages.\n        You can register multiple webhooks, and each one will be called.  (Note: you can also use our [Web App](https://www.bulksms.com/account/#!/advanced-settings/webhooks) to manage your webhooks interactively.)  \n        If you want to be notified of `SENT` messages and `RECEIVED` messages you need to create two webhooks.\n\n        ### Implementing your webhook\n\n        Code samples of Webhook implementations:\n        * [PHP](samples/webhook-php.html)\n\n        When you implement your webhook, there are a few rules to be aware of:\n        - Your webhook must process `POST` requests that contains an array of messages in the post body.  This input given to your webhook has the same structure as the output produced when you call [Retrieve Messages](#tag/Message%2Fpaths%2F~1messages%2Fget).\n        - When you register or update your webhook, the URL will be tested by invoking it with an empty array (`[]`).\n        - It is possible for your webhook to receive multiple updates for the same message and status. It happens from time to time that the mobile network duplicates status updates.\n        - The order by which the webhook is invoked can be unexpected.  For example, if sender A replies before sender B, your webhook might get the reply from B first.\n        - The webhook is expected to comply with good practices with regard to the status code it responds with.\n          - A status code in the `1xx` and `2xx` range is taken as an acknowledgement that the invocation was received and that the webhook host is ready to receive another.\n          - A status code in the `4xx` range is taken as a permanent problem and indicates that the webhook cannot process the message. The specific message that caused the error will be discarded, but your webhook will be invoked again when another message becomes available.\n          - Any other status code will be taken as a temporary problem; and indicates that the BulkSMS system should retry. The specific message that caused the error will not be discarded and your webhook will be invoked again with this message (see the subsequent section for more details on retry processing).\n        - Your webhook has to respond within `30` seconds.  If no response is given in this time, the invocation will be retried.\n        - It is good idea to add a secret to your URL in order to make it more secure. Here is an example:\n        `https://www.example.com/hook.php?secret=pass763265word`\n        - You can use a non-standard port if necessary, for example: `https://www.example.com:8321/hook.php?secret=pass763265word`\n\n\n        ### The retry process\n\n        The process the BulkSMS systems follow to handle retries is roughly the following:\n        - The first retry is scheduled for 90 seconds into the future.\n        - After the first retry, subsequent failures will have longer delays, following this sequence - 3 minutes, 6 minutes, 12 minutes thereafter the message will be retried every 15 minutes for a 2 day period.\n        - When all retries fail, the message will be discarded.\n\n        ### Problem reports via email\n\n        Your are strongly advised to provide an email address when you register your webhook.\n        An notice will be sent to this email address to keep you in the loop whenever there are problems with your webhook.\n        In order to prevent your inbox from being flooded, the system sends a notice about an observed error no more than once in a 24 hour period.\n\n        The following emails can be expected\n         - A __message retrying__ email is sent after an invocation has failed with a retry-able error.  This email is an early warning, allowing you to investigate your systems.\n         - A __message discarded__ email is sent after failure email is send when a message is discarded as a consequence of a non-retry-able error.\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: \"#/components/schemas/WebhookEntry\"\n        description: |\n          Contains the property values for your new webhook\n        required: true\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Webhook\"\n          description: Contains the webhook you created\n        \"400\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/bad-webhook-url\"\n      security:\n        - basicAuth: []\n      summary: Create a webhook\n      tags:\n        - Webhooks\n  \"/webhooks/{id}\":\n    delete:\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: The webhook was deleted successfully\n        \"404\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/bad-webhook-id\"\n      summary: Delete a webhook\n      tags:\n        - Webhooks\n    get:\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Webhook\"\n          description: The properties of a specific webhook\n        \"400\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/bad-webhook-url\"\n        \"404\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/bad-webhook-id\"\n      summary: Read a webhook\n      tags:\n        - Webhooks\n    parameters:\n      - description: The `id` of the webhook\n        in: path\n        name: id\n        required: true\n        schema:\n          type: string\n    post:\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: \"#/components/schemas/WebhookEntry\"\n        description: |\n          Contains the new property values for the webhook\n        required: true\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Webhook\"\n          description: The properties of the updated webhook\n        \"404\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/bad-webhook-id\"\n      summary: Update a webhook\n      tags:\n        - Webhooks\ncomponents:\n  responses:\n    bad-request:\n      content:\n        application/json:\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Error\"\n      description: Bad Request.

Use this option if your webhook logic is unable to handle more than one messages at a time.\n\n            If the value is `MANY` the array POSTed to your webhook can contain up to 10 messages.  This is the recommended option.  The number of calls made to your webhook would be less and this will speed up your total processing time.\n            If your webhook fails for an invoke that has more than one message, each message in the array will automatically be retried one at a time. \n\n            This value defaults to `ONE` - but it is recommended that you set this property to `MANY`.\n          enum:\n            - ONE\n            - MANY\n          example: MANY\n          type: string\n        name:\n          description: |\n            A text identifier for the webhook.\n            More than one webhook cannot have the same name.\n          example: My MT Webhook\n          type: string\n        onWebApp:\n          description: |\n            Indicates whether you want to show this webhook on the Web App.\n\n            Webhooks shown there can be updated by the user that use the public Web site.\n\n            The default value is `true`.\n          example: true\n          type: boolean\n        triggerScope:\n          description: |\n            Specifies when the webhook will be triggered.  \n\n            Please note the values are case sensitive.\n\n            If the value is `SENT`, the webhook will be called when a status update becomes available for a message you sent (i.e. a mobile terminating (MT) message).\n\n            If the value is `RECEIVED`, the webhook will be called when a message is received (i.e. a mobile originating (MO) message).\n\n            Note that this field forces you to create two separate webhook entries if you want to collect all messages.  However,  you can use the same `url` for both webhooks if you want.\n          enum:\n            - SENT\n            - RECEIVED\n          example: SENT\n          type: string\n        url:\n          description: |\n            The location of the webhook.\n\n            In addition to being a [valid URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#Syntax), the url must also start with `http` or `https`.\n          example: https://www.example.com\n          type: string\n      required:\n        - name\n        - url\n        - triggerScope\n      type: object\n  securitySchemes:\n    basicAuth:\n      description: |\n        The API uses HTTP Basic Auth for authentication.\n\n        You are requested to preemptively provide the `Authorization` header in your requests and not wait until the server has provided a `401 Unauthorized` response.\n\n        Doing so will reduce the number of requests required to achieve your goal, which will improve overall performance.\n\n        You authenticate using either the username you supplied when you registered with [BulkSMS](https://www.bulksms.com) or with an _API Token_. API tokens can be created by logging into your account and visiting _Settings \u0026gt; Developer Settings \u0026gt; API Tokens_.\n\n        __Important:__\n        - Where possible, use an API Token instead of the username and password when writing software against the API.\n\n        Whether you use a username or an API Token, the values must be [Base64 encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) before using it in the header.\n        For example, if the username is `Aladdin` and the password is `OpenSesame`, the unencoded header value is `Aladdin:OpenSesame`.  After encoding, the full header becomes\n\n        ```\n        Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l\n        ```\n        When using an API token, the value to be encoded will be `\u003ctoken-id\u003e:\u003ctoken-secret\u003e`.  These values _before Base64 encoding_ look something like this\n\n        `\n        BBDE1B476E03498AA768F66A286AABDC-01-B:9jSbVDK20!MXdfRGiIIFu#ffUE8*S\n        `\n      scheme: basic\n      type: http\n",
