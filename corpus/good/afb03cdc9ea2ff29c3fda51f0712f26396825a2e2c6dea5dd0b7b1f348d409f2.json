Information is made available from events operating around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eFor FRC, information is made available by the Field Management System (FMS) server operating at each event site. The FMS will attempt to sync all data from the event to \"the cloud\" as long as internet is available at the venue. If internet is unavailable, or \"goes down\" during the event, the FMS will automatically sync all data from the time the system was offline as soon as the connection is restored. The API will provide data as soon as it has synced, and we do not add any artificial delays. If you are receiving \"stale\" data, it may be because of connectivity problems at the venue. We recommend you try again later, and post on the FIRST FMS TeamForge site if the problem persists. \u003cem\u003e(Note: FMS does not sync while a match is running, so data that has to do with a particular match should become available once the score has been revealed to the audience at the event.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ch3 id=\"migration-and-program-notes\"\u003eMigration and Program Notes:\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ePay close attention to the addresses for calling the various endpoints- as well as the notes regarding endpoints with multiple possible responses (i.e. score details and rankings).\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ch1 id=\"documentation-notes\"\u003eDocumentation Notes\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eAll times are listed in the local time to the event venue. HTTP-date values will show their timezone.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eIf you specify a parameter, but no value for that parameter, it will be ignored. For example, if you request \u003cstrong\u003eURL?teamNumber=\u003c/strong\u003e the \u003cstrong\u003eteamNumber\u003c/strong\u003e parameter would be ignored.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eWe will continue to support the current version of the API plus one version older. Old APIs are depricated once a version \"two times newer\" is available, at minimum 6 months. For example, version 2.0 and 1.0 are supported right now, but 1.0 will not be supported once 2.1 (or 3.0) is available. Versions may also be retired earlier with prior notice here in the documentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThe full host address of the API is needed in all calls. The version number is required in each call in order to ensure your requests are made (and responses are returned) in the formats you anticipate. The version number for this documentation is found on the top of the page, in the title. If you call this version number, the API responses will match the formats listed below.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eAll of the APIs are capable of accepting the \u003cstrong\u003eAccept\u003c/strong\u003e HTTP header with either \u003cstrong\u003eapplication/xml\u003c/strong\u003e or \u003cstrong\u003eapplication/json\u003c/strong\u003e based on the desired return type. Any API call that results in an \u003cstrong\u003eHTTP Status Code\u003c/strong\u003e other than \u003cstrong\u003e200 (OK)\u003c/strong\u003e will only be shown here as an \u003cstrong\u003eapplication/json\u003c/strong\u003e response to save space, but the content is the same regardless of the request type. All response will have a \u003cstrong\u003eContent-Length\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eDate\u003c/strong\u003e response header, but those are not shown in the documentaiton.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eFor all APIs that accept a query string in addition to the URI base, the order of parameters do not matter, but the name shown in the documentation must match exactly, as does the associated value format as described in details.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eFor response codes that are not \u003cstrong\u003eHTTP 200 (OK)\u003c/strong\u003e, the documentation will show a body message that represents a possible response value. While the \"title\" of the \u003cstrong\u003eHTTP Status Code\u003c/strong\u003e will match those shown in the response codes documentation section exactly, the body of the response will be a more detailed explanation of why that status code is being returned and may not always be exactly as shown in the examples.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eNone of the APIs will show possible return here in the documentation of \u003cstrong\u003eHTTP 401 (Unauthorized)\u003c/strong\u003e, but that code applies to all APIs as a possible response if the request is made without a valid token.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ch3 id=\"last-modified-fms-onlymodifiedsince-and-if-modified-since-headers\"\u003eLast-Modified, FMS-OnlyModifiedSince, and If-Modified-Since Headers\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThe FRC Events API utilizes the \u003cstrong\u003eLast-Modified\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eIf-Modified-Since\u003c/strong\u003e Headers to communicate with consumers regarding the age of the data they are requesting. With a couple of exceptions, all calls will return a \u003cstrong\u003eLast-Modified\u003c/strong\u003e Header set with the time at which the data at that endpoint was last modified. The Header will always be set in the HTTP-date format, as described in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html\"\u003eHTTP Protocol\u003c/a\u003e. There are two exceptions: the \u003cstrong\u003eLast-Modified\u003c/strong\u003e Header is not set if the endpoint returns no results (such as a request for a schedule with no matches) and will also not be set if the request was an \u003cstrong\u003eHTTP DELETE\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eConsumers should keep track of the \u003cstrong\u003eLast-Modified\u003c/strong\u003e Header, and return it on subsequent calls to the same endpoint as the \u003cstrong\u003eIf-Modified-Since\u003c/strong\u003e. The server will recognize this request, and will only return a result if the data has been modified since the last request. If no changes have been made, an \u003cstrong\u003eHTTP 304\u003c/strong\u003e will be returned. If data has been modified, ALL data on that call will be returned (for \"only modified\" data, see below).\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThe FRC Events API also allows a custom header used to filter the return data to a specific subset. This is done by specifying a \u003cstrong\u003eFMS-OnlyModifiedSince\u003c/strong\u003e header with each call. As with the \u003cstrong\u003eIf-Modified-Since\u003c/strong\u003e header, consumers should keep track of the \u003cstrong\u003eLast-Modified\u003c/strong\u003e Header, and return it on subsequent calls to the same endpoint as the \u003cstrong\u003eFMS-OnlyModifiedSince\u003c/strong\u003e Header. The server will recognize this request, and will only return a result if the data has been modified since the last request, and, if returned, the data will only be those portions modified since the included date. If no changes, have been made, an \u003cstrong\u003eHTTP 304\u003c/strong\u003e will be returned. Using this method, the server and consumer save processing time by only receiving modified data that is in need of update on the consumer side.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eIf the Headers are improperly passed (such as the wrong Day of Week for the matching date, or a date in the future), the endpoint will simply ignore the Header and return all results. If both headers are specified, the request will be denied.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ch1 id=\"response-codes\"\u003eResponse Codes\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThe FRC Events API HTTP Status Codes correspond with the \u003ca href=\"https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html\"\u003ecommon codes\u003c/a\u003e, but occasionally with different \"titles\". The \"title\" used by the API is shown next to each of the below possible response HTTP Status Codes. Throughout the documentation, Apiary may automatically show the common \"title\" in example returns (like \"Not Found\" for 404) but on the production server, the \"title\" will instead match those listed below.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cpre class=\"click-to-expand-wrapper is-snippet-wrapper\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eHTTP 200 - \"OK\"\n    \u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe request has succeeded. An entity corresponding to the requested resource is sent in the response. This will be returned as the HTTP Status Code for all request that succeed, even if the body is empty (such as an event that has no rankings, but with a valid season and event code were used)\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cpre class=\"click-to-expand-wrapper is-snippet-wrapper\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eHTTP 304 - \"Not Modified\"\n    \u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen utilizing a Header that allows filtered data returns, such as \u003cstrong\u003eIf-Modified-Since\u003c/strong\u003e, this response indicates that no data meets the request.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cpre class=\"click-to-expand-wrapper is-snippet-wrapper\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eHTTP 400 - \"Invalid Season Requested\"/\"Malformed Parameter Format In Request\"/\"Missing Parameter In Request\"/\"Invalid API Version Requested\":\n    \u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications. Specifically for this API, a 400 response indicates that the requested URI matches with a valid API, but one or more required parameter was malformed or invalid. Examples include an event code that is too short or team number that contains a letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cpre class=\"click-to-expand-wrapper is-snippet-wrapper\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eHTTP 401 - \"Unauthorized\"\n    \u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll requests against the API require authentication via a valid user token. Failing to provide one, or providing an invalid one, will warrant a 401 response. The client MAY repeat the request with a suitable Authorization header field.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cpre class=\"click-to-expand-wrapper is-snippet-wrapper\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eHTTP 404 - \"Invalid Event Requested\"\n    \u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven though the 404 code usually indicates any not found status, a 404 will only be issued in this API when an event cannot be found for the requested season and event code. If the request didn't match a valid API or there were malformed parameters, the response would not receive a 404 but rather a 400 or 501. If this HTTP code is received, the season was a valid season and the event code matched the acceptable style of an event code, but there were no records of an event matching the combination of that season and event code. For example, HTTP 404 would be issued when the event had a different code in the requested season (the codes can change year to year based on event location).\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cpre class=\"click-to-expand-wrapper is-snippet-wrapper\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eHTTP 500 - \"Internal Server Error\"\n    \u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.

Specifically, the request pattern did not match any of the possible APIs, and thus processing was discontinued. This code is also issued when too many optional parameters were included in a single request and fulfilling it would make the result confusing or misleading. Each API will specify which parameters or combination of parameters can be used at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cpre class=\"click-to-expand-wrapper is-snippet-wrapper\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eHTTP 503 - \"Service Unavailable\"\n    \u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server.

This is a code sent directly by the server, and has no special alternate definition specific to this API.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eSee the notes at the top of this documentation for important information about HTTP Status Codes.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ch1 id=\"authorization\"\u003eAuthorization\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eIn order to make calls against the FRC Events API, you must include an HTTP Header called \u003cstrong\u003eAuthorization\u003c/strong\u003e with the value set as specified below. If a request is made without this header, processing stops and an \u003cstrong\u003eHTTP 401\u003c/strong\u003e is issued. All \u003cstrong\u003eAuthorization\u003c/strong\u003e headers follow the same format:\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eAuthorization: Basic 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eWhere the Zeros are replaced by your Token.
