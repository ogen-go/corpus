It is assumed that providing a very low multiplier (like 0.0001) will never lead to a transaction being created with a fee less than the minimum network fee (if applicable). In the case that the caller provides both a max fee and a suggested fee multiplier, the max fee will set an upper bound on the suggested fee (regardless of the multiplier provided).\",\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"required\": [\n          \"network_identifier\",\n          \"operations\"\n        ],\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"network_identifier\": {\n            \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/NetworkIdentifier\"\n          },\n          \"operations\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"items\": {\n              \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/Operation\"\n            }\n          },\n          \"metadata\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\"\n          },\n          \"max_fee\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"items\": {\n              \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/Amount\"\n            }\n          },\n          \"suggested_fee_multiplier\": {\n            \"type\": \"number\",\n            \"format\": \"double\",\n            \"minimum\": 0\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"ConstructionPreprocessResponse\": {\n        \"description\": \"ConstructionPreprocessResponse contains the request that will be sent directly to `/construction/metadata`.
