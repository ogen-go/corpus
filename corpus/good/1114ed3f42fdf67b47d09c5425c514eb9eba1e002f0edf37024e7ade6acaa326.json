For\n        private repositories, you must use an access token with the `repo` scope.

This is a useful option if you want to preserve at least one analysis\n        for the specified tool in your repository.\n        Use the `confirm_delete_url` URL if you are content to remove all analyses for a tool.\n        When you delete the last analysis in a set, the value of `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`\n        in the 200 response is `null`.\n\n        As an example of the deletion process,\n        let's imagine that you added a workflow that configured a particular code scanning tool\n        to analyze the code in a repository. This tool has added 15 analyses:\n        10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch.\n        You therefore have two separate sets of analyses for this tool.\n        You've now decided that you want to remove all of the analyses for the tool.\n        To do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests.\n        To start, you must find an analysis that's identified as deletable.\n        Each set of analyses always has one that's identified as deletable.\n        Having found the deletable analysis for one of the two sets,\n        delete this analysis and then continue deleting the next analysis in the set until they're all deleted.\n        Then repeat the process for the second set.\n        The procedure therefore consists of a nested loop:\n\n        **Outer loop**:\n        * List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool.\n        * Parse this list to find a deletable analysis. If found:\n\n          **Inner loop**:\n          * Delete the identified analysis.\n          * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration.\n\n        The above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the tool's analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the specified repository, and it therefore uses the `confirm_delete_url` value. Alternatively, you could use the `next_analysis_url` value, which would leave the last analysis in each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool's analysis entirely.\n      operationId: code-scanning/delete-analysis\n      tags:\n        - code-scanning\n      externalDocs:\n        description: API method documentation\n        url: https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/code-scanning#delete-a-code-scanning-analysis-from-a-repository\n      parameters:\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/owner'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/repo'\n        - name: analysis_id\n          in: path\n          description: The ID of the analysis, as returned from the `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/code-scanning/analyses` operation.\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: integer\n        - name: confirm_delete\n          in: query\n          description: 'Allow deletion if the specified analysis is the last in a set.

You must use an access token with the `security_events` scope to use this endpoint for private repositories. You can also use tokens with the `public_repo` scope for public repositories only. GitHub Apps must have the `security_events` write permission to use this endpoint.\n\n        There are two places where you can upload code scanning results.\n         - If you upload to a pull request, for example `--ref refs/pull/42/merge` or `--ref refs/pull/42/head`, then the results appear as alerts in a pull request check. For more information, see \"[Triaging code scanning alerts in pull requests](/code-security/secure-coding/triaging-code-scanning-alerts-in-pull-requests).\"\n         - If you upload to a branch, for example `--ref refs/heads/my-branch`, then the results appear in the **Security** tab for your repository. For more information, see \"[Managing code scanning alerts for your repository](/code-security/secure-coding/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository#viewing-the-alerts-for-a-repository).\"\n\n        You must compress the SARIF-formatted analysis data that you want to upload, using `gzip`, and then encode it as a Base64 format string. For example:\n\n        ```\n        gzip -c analysis-data.sarif | base64 -w0\n        ```\n\n        SARIF upload supports a maximum of 5000 results per analysis run. Any results over this limit are ignored and any SARIF uploads with more than 25,000 results are rejected. Typically, but not necessarily, a SARIF file contains a single run of a single tool. If a code scanning tool generates too many results, you should update the analysis configuration to run only the most important rules or queries.\n\n        The `202 Accepted`, response includes an `id` value.\n        You can use this ID to check the status of the upload by using this for the `/sarifs/{sarif_id}` endpoint.\n        For more information, see \"[Get information about a SARIF upload](/rest/reference/code-scanning#get-information-about-a-sarif-upload).\"\n      operationId: code-scanning/upload-sarif\n      tags:\n        - code-scanning\n      externalDocs:\n        description: API method documentation\n        url: https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/code-scanning#upload-a-sarif-file\n      parameters:\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/owner'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/repo'\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n              properties:\n                commit_sha:\n                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/code-scanning-analysis-commit-sha'\n                ref:\n                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/code-scanning-ref'\n                sarif:\n                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/code-scanning-analysis-sarif-file'\n                checkout_uri:\n                  description: |-\n                    The base directory used in the analysis, as it appears in the SARIF file.\n                    This property is used to convert file paths from absolute to relative, so that alerts can be mapped to their correct location in the repository.\n                  example: file:///github/workspace/\n                  type: string\n                  format: uri\n                started_at:\n                  description: 'The time that the analysis run began.
