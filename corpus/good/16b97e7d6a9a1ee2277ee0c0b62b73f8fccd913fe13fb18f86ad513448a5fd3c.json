Main difference comparing to the Public Bets API is that B2B Bets API captures unique id off the actual bettor in the partner's system.    \n    \n    It should be used in the conjunction with the Public API to get the fixtures, odds and bets.\n\n    # Authentication \n    \n    Access is restricted by IP address. Partner would have to provide the list of IP addresses from where it would access the API. \n    \n  \n    B2B API authentication requires both:  \n      - [HTTP Basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)\n      - Api key authentication\n\n      Partner key identifies the partner and can be used with any client credentials partner may have.  \n      Pinnacle will provide the api key (partner key) upon approval to use the B2B API. \n \n    You need to send `Authorization ` and `X-PARTNER-KEY` HTTP headers, e.g.\n    \n    ```\n    \n      POST /b2b/v2/bets/straight HTTP/1.1\n      User-Agent: Apache-HttpClient/4.5.2\n      Host: api.pinnacle.com\n      Authorization: Basic am9uYXRoYW46cmljaG1hbg==\n      Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\n      X-Partner-Key: B4B480D3-EB1B-44DB-AA9C-197A229EF717\n      Connection: Keep-Alive\n    ```\n   \n    \n  x-logo:\n    url: \u003e-\n      https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/31601407?s=400\u0026u=f3c6e1cfc8a26665e4a4df6d8da4a7ee527aeceb\u0026v=4\n\nservers:\n  -
