The following headers\n            are required: - `kid`: The identifier of the signing key securing the\n            JWT. - `alg`: The cryptographic algorithm securing the JWT. Must be `RS256`\n            or `ES256`. The following payload fields are required.

Shorter expiration times are more\n            secure. If possible, we recommend setting an expiration time less than\n            6 hours. - `sub`: The identity asserted in the JWT. - `aud`: For workload\n            identity pools, this must be a value specified in the allowed audiences\n            for the workload identity pool provider, or one of the audiences allowed\n            by default if no audiences were specified.

This token contains the same information as a request to the AWS\n            [`GetCallerIdentity()`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetCallerIdentity)\n            method, as well as the AWS [signature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html)\n            for the request information. Use Signature Version 4. Format the request\n            as URL-encoded JSON, and set the `subject_token_type` parameter to `urn:ietf:params:aws:token-type:aws4_request`.\n            The following parameters are required: - `url`: The URL of the AWS STS\n            endpoint for `GetCallerIdentity()`, such as `https://sts.amazonaws.com?Action=GetCallerIdentity\u0026Version=2011-06-15`.\n            Regional endpoints are also supported. - `method`: The HTTP request method:\n            `POST`. - `headers`: The HTTP request headers, which must include: - `Authorization`:\n            The request signature. - `x-amz-date`: The time you will send the request,\n            formatted as an [ISO8601 Basic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4_elements.html#sigv4_elements_date)\n            string. This value is typically set to the current time and is used to\n            help prevent replay attacks. - `host`: The hostname of the `url` field;\n            for example, `sts.amazonaws.com`. - `x-goog-cloud-target-resource`: The\n            full, canonical resource name of the workload identity pool provider,\n            with or without an `https:` prefix. To help ensure data integrity, we\n            recommend including this header in the `SignedHeaders` field of the signed\n            request. For example: //iam.googleapis.com/projects//locations/global/workloadIdentityPools//providers/\n            https://iam.googleapis.com/projects//locations/global/workloadIdentityPools//providers/\n            If you are using temporary security credentials provided by AWS, you must\n            also include the header `x-amz-security-token`, with the value set to\n            the session token. The following example shows a `GetCallerIdentity` token:\n            ``` { \"headers\": [ {\"key\": \"x-amz-date\", \"value\": \"20200815T015049Z\"},\n            {\"key\": \"Authorization\", \"value\": \"AWS4-HMAC-SHA256+Credential=$credential,+SignedHeaders=host;x-amz-date;x-goog-cloud-target-resource,+Signature=$signature\"},\n            {\"key\": \"x-goog-cloud-target-resource\", \"value\": \"//iam.googleapis.com/projects//locations/global/workloadIdentityPools//providers/\"},\n            {\"key\": \"host\", \"value\": \"sts.amazonaws.com\"} . ], \"method\": \"POST\", \"url\":\n            \"https://sts.amazonaws.com?Action=GetCallerIdentity\u0026Version=2011-06-15\"\n            } ``` You can also use a Google-issued OAuth 2.0 access token with this\n            field to obtain an access token with new security attributes applied,\n            such as a Credential Access Boundary. In this case, set `subject_token_type`\n            to `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token`.
