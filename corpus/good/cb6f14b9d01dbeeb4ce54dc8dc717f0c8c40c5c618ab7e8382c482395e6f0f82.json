SCAIFE facilitates auditing static analysis meta-alerts using\n  classifiers, optional adaptive heuristics, and meta-alert\n  prioritization. SCAIFE enables jump-starting labeled datasets using\n  test suites. It is intended to enable a wide range of users (with\n  widely varying datasets, static analysis tools, machine learning\n  expertise, and amount of labeled data) to benefit from using\n  classifiers and sophisticated prioritization to automatically triage\n  static analysis meta-alerts.\"\n  version: \"2.0.0\"\n  contact:\n    name: \"SCAIFE Project\"\n    url: \"https://www.sei.cmu.edu/research-capabilities/all-work/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_4050=6453\"\n    email: \"lflynn@cert.org\"\n  license:\n    name: |-\n      SCAIFE API Copyright 2007-2021 Carnegie Mellon University.
