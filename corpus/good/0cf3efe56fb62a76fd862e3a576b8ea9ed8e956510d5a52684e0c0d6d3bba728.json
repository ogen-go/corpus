To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as\\\n    \\ the value, for example:\\n\\n ```\\ncurl\\n-H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\"\\\n    \\ \\\\\\n-H \\\"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\\\" \\\\\\n...\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively, you can use\\\n    \\ the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication.\\\n    \\ For example:\\n\\n```\\ncurl\\n-H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\" \\\\\\n-U \\\"ws@BalancePlatform.YOUR_BALANCE_PLATFORM\\\"\\\n    :\\\"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD\\\" \\\\\\n...\\n```\\n## Roles and permissions\\nTo use the Balance\\\n    \\ Platforms Transfers API, you need an additional role for your API credential.\\\n    \\ Transfers must also be enabled for the source balance account. Your Adyen contact\\\n    \\ will set up the roles and permissions for you.\\n## Versioning\\nThe Balance Platform\\\n    \\ Transfers API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning)\\\n    \\ using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format:\\\n    \\ \\\"vXX\\\", where XX is the version number.\\n\\nFor example:\\n```\\nhttps://balanceplatform-api-test.adyen.com/btl/v1\\n\\\n    ```\\n## Going live\\nWhen going live, your Adyen contact will provide your API\\\n    \\ credential for the live environment. You can then use the username and password\\\n    \\ to send requests to `https://balanceplatform-api-live.adyen.com/btl/v1`.\\n\\n\\\n    For more information, refer to our [Going live documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/issuing/integration-checklist#going-live).\"\n  x-timestamp: '2022-03-22T20:02:57Z'\n  termsOfService: https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions\n  contact:\n    name: Adyen Developer Experience team\n    url: https://www.adyen.help/hc/en-us/community/topics\n    email: developer-experience@adyen.com\nx-groups:\n- Transfers\n- Transactions\ntags:\n- name: Transactions\n- name: Transfers\npaths:\n  /transactions:\n    get:\n      tags:\n      - Transactions\n      summary: Get all transactions\n      description: Returns transactions that match the query parameters.
