These management operations include, for example, the transfer\\\n    \\ of funds from one account to another, the payout of funds to an account holder,\\\n    \\ and the retrieval of balances in an account.\\n\\nFor more information, refer\\\n    \\ to our [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/platforms).\\n## Authentication\\n\\\n    Your Adyen contact will provide your API credential and an API key. To connect\\\n    \\ to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:\\n\\\n    \\n ```\\ncurl\\n-H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\" \\\\\\n-H \\\"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\\\"\\\n    \\ \\\\\\n...\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively, you can use the username and password to connect\\\n    \\ to the API using basic authentication. For example:\\n\\n```\\ncurl\\n-U \\\"ws@MarketPlace.YOUR_PLATFORM_ACCOUNT\\\"\\\n    :\\\"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD\\\" \\\\\\n-H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\" \\\\\\n...\\n```\\n\\\n    When going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access\\\n    \\ the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\\n\\\n    \\n## Versioning\\nThe Fund API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning)\\\n    \\ using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format:\\\n    \\ \\\"vXX\\\", where XX is the version number.\\n\\nFor example:\\n```\\nhttps://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Fund/v6/accountHolderBalance\\n\\\n    ```\"\n  x-timestamp: '2022-04-21T16:24:56Z'\n  termsOfService: https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions\n  contact:\n    name: Adyen Developer Experience team\n    url: https://www.adyen.help/hc/en-us/community/topics\n    email: developer-experience@adyen.com\nx-groups:\n- General\ntags:\n- name: General\npaths:\n  /accountHolderBalance:\n    post:\n      tags:\n      - General\n      summary: Get the balances of an account holder\n      description: 'Returns the account balances of an account holder.
