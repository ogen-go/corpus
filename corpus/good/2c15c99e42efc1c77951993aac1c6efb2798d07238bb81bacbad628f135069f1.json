A captcha is a small image that is shown to a user in order for the user to\n    supply some textual response from the image in order to verify that the operator is likely to be human and not a\n    computer.  This helps to prevent machine-hacking of systems.  This API is able to provide a captcha and other\n    APIs require that a 'captcha response' is supplied as part of a request.  In general a captcha is valid for a\n    certain length of time.\npaths:\n  /__api/v2/captcha/generate-captcha:\n    description: \u003e\n      This method will return a captcha that can be used in systems where a captcha response (generated by a\n      human) is required to be supplied with an API request.\n    post:\n      operationId: captcha:generate-captcha\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: \u003e\n            The generated captcha data.\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                type: object\n                properties:\n                  token:\n                    type: string\n                    description: \u003e\n                      This token uniquely identifies the captcha.\n                  pngImageDataBase64:\n                      type: string\n                      description: \u003e\n                        This is a base-64 encoded image of the captcha.  It could, for example, be used with\n                        a data url to render the image in an \"img\" tag on a web page.\n\n\n\n",
