The Product Order Item is currently being assessed to determine whether the Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date is valid. If there is a charge associated with the Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date, the Product Order remains in the `pending.assessingModification` state until the Charge is completed or withdrawn by the Seller. Once the Buyer's request has been validated and any associated Charges completed, the Product Order returns to the `inProgress` state.                                                                                                       |\n        | `cancelled`                     | CANCELLED              | The Product Order has been successfully cancelled.

A Product Offering\n        defines all of the commercial terms and, through association with a\n        particular Product Specification, defines all the technical attributes\n        and behaviors of the Product. A Product Offering may constrain the\n        allowable set of configurable technical attributes and/or behaviors\n        specified in the associated Product Specification.\n      properties:\n        href:\n          description: \u003e\n            Hyperlink to a Product Offering in Sellers catalog.
