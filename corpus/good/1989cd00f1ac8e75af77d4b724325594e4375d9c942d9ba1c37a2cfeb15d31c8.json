These related entities include account holders, accounts, bank accounts, shareholders, and KYC-related documents. The management operations include actions such as creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of them.\n\n    For more information, refer to our [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/platforms).\n    ## Authentication\n    To connect to the Account API, you must use basic authentication credentials of your web service user. If you don't have one, contact the [Adyen Support Team](https://support.adyen.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:\n\n    ```\n    curl\n    -U \"ws@MarketPlace.YourMarketPlace\":\"YourWsPassword\" \\\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    ...\n    ```\n    Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n    ## Versioning\n    The Account API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\n    For example:\n    ```\n    https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Account/v3/createAccountHolder\n    ```\n  termsOfService: https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions\n  title: \"Adyen for Platforms: Account API\"\n  version: \"3\"\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    - payment\n  x-logo:\n    url: https://twitter.com/Adyen/profile_image?size=original\n  x-origin:\n    - converter:\n        url: https://github.com/mermade/oas-kit\n        version: 7.0.4\n      format: openapi\n      url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adyen/adyen-openapi/master/json/AccountService-v3.json\n      version: \"3.1\"\n  x-preferred: false\n  x-providerName: adyen.com\n  x-publicVersion: true\n  x-serviceName: AccountService\npaths:\n  /closeAccount:\n    post:\n      description: Closes an account.
