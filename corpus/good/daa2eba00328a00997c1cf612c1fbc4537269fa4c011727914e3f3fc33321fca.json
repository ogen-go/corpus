The related entities include account holders only. \\nFor more information,\\\n    \\ refer to our [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/platforms/onboarding-and-verification/hosted-onboarding-page).\\n\\\n    ## Authentication\\nTo connect to the HOP API, you must use basic authentication\\\n    \\ credentials of your web service user. If you don't have one, please contact\\\n    \\ the [Adyen Support Team](https://support.adyen.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Then\\\n    \\ use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:\\n\\n```\\ncurl\\n\\\n    -U \\\"ws@MarketPlace.YourMarketPlace\\\":\\\"YourWsPassword\\\" \\\\\\n-H \\\"Content-Type:\\\n    \\ application/json\\\" \\\\\\n...\\n```\\nNote that when going live, you need to generate\\\n    \\ new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\\n\\\n    \\n## Versioning\\nThe HOP API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version\\\n    \\ suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \\\"vXX\\\", where\\\n    \\ XX is the version number.\\n\\nFor example:\\n```\\nhttps://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Hop/v6/getOnboardingUrl\\n\\\n    ```\"\n  termsOfService: https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions\n  title: 'Adyen for Platforms: Hosted Onboarding'\n  version: \"6\"\nservers:\n- url: https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Hop/v6\npaths:\n  /getOnboardingUrl:\n    post:\n      description: \"Returns a link to a Hosted Onboarding Page (HOP) to be used by\\\n        \\ a specific account holder.
