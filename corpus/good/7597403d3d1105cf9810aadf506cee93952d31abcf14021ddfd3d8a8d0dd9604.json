The Product Order Item is currently being assessed to determine whether the Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date is valid. If there is a charge associated with the Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date, the Product Order remains in the `pending.assessingModification` state until the Charge is completed or withdrawn by the Seller. Once the Buyer's request has been validated and any associated Charges completed, the Product Order returns to the `inProgress` state.                                                                                                       |\n        | `cancelled`                     | CANCELLED              | The Product Order has been successfully cancelled.
