If you do not have an auth key yet, you can obtain one from your [Account Page](/account). \n\n     A `User-Agent` header may need to be set to prevent a 403 Unauthorized error.\n  title: The Blue Alliance API v3\n  version: 3.8.0\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    - open_data\n  x-changes: \"3.8.0-3.8.1: Added Webcast date field. 3.7.0-3.8.0: Added 2020 Match Breakdown. 3.6.0-3.7.0: Added Zebra MotionWorks endpoints and models. 3.5.2-3.6.0: Added `school_name` to the Team model. 3.5.1-3.5.2: Removed `key` from the Media object, set `foreign_key` as a required property. 3.5-3.5.1: Fixed api clients crashing when requesting simple matches resulting in ties. 3.04.1 - 3.5: Updated the spec to follow OpenAPI standards. 3.04.0 - 3.04.1: Team motto will now return null. 3.03.1 - 3.04.0: Add direct_url and view_url to the Media model. 3.03.0 - 3.03.1: Fix model of /team/{team_key}/robots to match API, add min and max for year and add min for page_num. 3.02.1 - 3.03.0: Added Timeseries models and endpoints. 3.02.0 - 3.02.1: Fixed the model for `/team/{team_key}/districts` to match return from API. 3.1.0 - 3.02.0: Added `tba_gameData` to score breakdown and a leading zero to the minor version number to allow for easier sorting later. 3.0.5 - 3.1.0: Version bump for 2018 added fields and endpoints. Models Updated: `Team_Event_Status`, `Media`, 2018 Score Breakdowns. Endpoints Added: `/team/{team_key}/events/{year}/statuses`, `/event/{event_key}/teams/statuses` 3.0.4 - 3.0.5: Minor spelling fixes. Remove 2016 fields from `Match_Score_Breakdown_2017_Alliance` model. Fix `first_event_id` in `Event` model to correct type. Update `Media`.`type` enum. --- 3.0.3 - 3.0.4: Correct syntax in `Team_Event_Status_playoff` object, include descriptions in `Event_District_Points` and fix the path in `Team_Event_Status_playoff.properties.record` in order to more closely match Swagger spec. Fix syntax of `Match.video` to be correct and accurately reflect what is returned by the API. --- 3.0.2 - 3.0.3: `extra_stats` and `extra_stats_info` added to `Event_Ranking` model. Corrected match video property claiming to use the `Media` model, which it doesn't. Added `first_event_code` to the `Event` model. Added `/team/{team_key}/media/tag/{media_tag}` and year endpoints. Added `dq_team_keys` to `Match_alliance` model.  --- 3.0.1 - 3.0.2: `Team_Event_Status` and `Event_Ranking` model documentation changed to reflect actual API return. Changes involved W-L-T and ranking properties. --- 3.0.0 - 3.0.1: Descriptions updated to clarify some terms and improve grammar. The `district` property on the `Event` object now points to the `District_List` model, which was identical. `Required` fields on fully documented models now represent fields that may not be `null`. `District_Ranking` model documented.\"\n  x-logo:\n    url: https://thebluealliance.com/icons/apple-touch-icon.png\n  x-origin:\n    - format: openapi\n      url: https://www.thebluealliance.com/swagger/api_v3.json\n      version: \"3.0\"\n  x-providerName: thebluealliance.com\n  x-version-info: Versions of the API follow the format X.Y.Z, with X being a major version, Y denoting the minor version, and Z the point release. Changes to the spec or API that result in a major version change will significantly impact implementations. Changes to the minor version indicate paths and/or fields in existing models may be added, and any breaking changes will be confined to paths or models listed as in-development in the prior minor version. Changes to the point release indicate no format or structure changes to the paths or models, but updated or clarified documentation.
