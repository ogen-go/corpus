The query is the main parameter used to define a query.\n            You can type several terms separated by spaces or phrases wrapped\n            inside quote ‘”’ characters. For every term, you can also use ‘+’\n            and ‘-‘ modifier characters to indicate that a term is “mandatory”\n            or “prohibited” (by default, terms are considered to be\n            “mandatory”). For example, in a query such as query=term_a -term_b,\n            sounds including term_b will not match the search criteria. The\n            query does a weighted search over some sound properties including\n            sound tags, the sound name, its description, pack name and the sound\n            id. Therefore, searching for query=123 will find you sounds with id\n            1234, sounds that have 1234 in the description, in the tags, etc.\n            You’ll find some examples below. Using an empty query (query= or\n            query=\"\") will return all Freeosund sounds.\n          in: query\n          name: query\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: Allows filtering query results.
