That's why our APIs are designed to make this\n    process as flexible and straightforward as possible.\n\n\n    ## Getting Started\n\n\n    This is an interactive documentation intended to help guide developers on\n    our API interface and allow simple and easy testing right here, in the\n    browser. When you select an endpoint, the machine column will be expanded,\n    displaying possible URI parameters, request and response schemas and\n    examples. \n\n\n    The endpoint can be tested with \"Switch to Console\" option, a simple editor\n    to form your test API request, specify URI parameters or request bodies. The\n    only thing you would need to add is an `Authorization` header with your\n    basic authentication information. Optionally, you can specify it for one\n    request and pin to make it global as you test.\n\n\n    Voxbone doesn't offer official SDKs for its APIs, but the swagger definition\n    of the endpoints can be downloaded and used to build [auto-generated\n    SDKs](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/) in many different\n    programming languages.\n\n\n    You can also get started with our collection in Postman below:\n\n    [![Run in\n    Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/11b0f2539ad8093ab09b)\n\n\n    ## Versions\n\n\n    We are actively developing powerful, agile and scalable APIs to unlock new\n    functionality and improve the efficiency of your Voice and SMS\n    communications.\n\n\n    If you would like to join our early access programme please __[contact\n    us](mailto:developers@voxbone.com)__.\n\n\n    |API Version|Description|Documentation|\n\n    |:---:|:---:|:---|\n\n    |`WS`|Our Legacy API version (`WS`) has been in a sunset period for an\n    extended period of time. It has been deprecated and will be decommissioned\n    on 8 August 2022.

You can do so on our [customer\n    platform homepage](https://voxbone.com/portal), under \"Additional Services\"\n    section, named \"Provisioning API\". If you have trouble seeing these\n    controls, reach out to your account manager or raise a support ticket. \n\n    - You've setup an API key. This control can be found under [Account \u003e\n    Account Settings on our customer\n    platform](https://www.voxbone.com/portal/account-settings?tab=apiPassword)\n\n\n    ## Environments\n\n\n    There are currently two environments for our platform's APIs: \n\n    - __Production__ : Sits on `api.voxbone.com` base url. Interacts with your\n    live and actual resources on Voxbone platform.\n\n    - __Sandbox__ : Sits on `api.sandbox.voxbone.com` base url. Intended for\n    simulating and testing your requests. For our CDR API please use production\n    while we develop Sandbox access.\n\n\n    ## Security \u0026 Rate Limiting\n\n\n    For protecting both your apps and our systems, a __20 requests per second by\n    client IP__ is performed on your API calls. If you send more requests to\n    Voxbone API endpoints, your requests may be rejected by an `HTTP 509\n    Bandwidth Limit Exceeded` or `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` in the response.\n  contact:\n    name: Bandwidth\n  version: '1.0'\nservers:\n  - url: https://api.voxbone.com/v2\ntags:\n  - name: CDRs\n    description: \u003e\n      We're really excited to release a brand new version of our CDR API.\n\n\n      With each CDR being provided in real-time, you can integrate the data into\n      your internal platform, using call quality metrics to identify call\n      experience issues before your customers or end-users do. You can also use\n      our API to perform instant billing or reconciliation.\n\n\n      To access the CDR API you will require a Voxbone Insights subscription,\n      __[sign up here today](https://www.voxbone.com/lp/insights-upgrade/)__.\npaths:\n  /cdr/calls:\n    get:\n      tags:\n        -
