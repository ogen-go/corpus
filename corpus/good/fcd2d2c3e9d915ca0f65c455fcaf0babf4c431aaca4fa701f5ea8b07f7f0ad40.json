To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:\n\n     ```\n    curl\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\n    ...\n    ```\n\n    Alternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication. For example:\n\n    ```\n    curl\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -U \"ws@BalancePlatform.YOUR_BALANCE_PLATFORM\":\"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD\" \\\n    ...\n    ```\n    ## Roles and permissions\n    To use the Balance Platforms Transfers API, you need an additional role for your API credential. Transfers must also be enabled for the source balance account. Your Adyen contact will set up the roles and permissions for you.\n    ## Versioning\n    The Balance Platform Transfers API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\n    For example:\n    ```\n    https://balanceplatform-api-test.adyen.com/btl/v1\n    ```\n    ## Going live\n    When going live, your Adyen contact will provide your API credential for the live environment. You can then use the username and password to send requests to `https://balanceplatform-api-live.adyen.com/btl/v1`.\n\n    For more information, refer to our [Going live documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/issuing/integration-checklist#going-live).\n  termsOfService: https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions\n  title: Balance Platform Transfers API\n  version: \"2\"\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    - payment\n  x-logo:\n    url: https://twitter.com/Adyen/profile_image?size=original\n  x-origin:\n    - format: openapi\n      url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adyen/adyen-openapi/master/json/TransferService-v2.json\n      version: \"3.1\"\n  x-preferred: true\n  x-providerName: adyen.com\n  x-publicVersion: true\n  x-serviceName: TransferService\npaths:\n  /transactions:\n    get:\n      description: |-\n        Returns transactions that match the query parameters.
