To connect to the API,\\\n    \\ add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:\\n\\n ```\\n\\\n    curl\\n-H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\" \\\\\\n-H \\\"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\\\"\\\n    \\ \\\\\\n...\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively, you can use the username and password to connect\\\n    \\ to the API using basic authentication. For example:\\n\\n```\\ncurl\\n-H \\\"Content-Type:\\\n    \\ application/json\\\" \\\\\\n-U \\\"ws@BalancePlatform.YOUR_BALANCE_PLATFORM\\\":\\\"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD\\\"\\\n    \\ \\\\\\n...\\n```\\n## Versioning\\nThe Balance Platform Configuration API supports\\\n    \\ [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using\\\n    \\ a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format:\\\n    \\ \\\"vXX\\\", where XX is the version number.\\n\\nFor example:\\n```\\nhttps://balanceplatform-api-test.adyen.com/bcl/v1\\n\\\n    ```\\n## Going live\\nWhen going live, your Adyen contact will provide your API\\\n    \\ credential for the live environment.
