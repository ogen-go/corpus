You can use the API to obtain information about a specific\n    terminal, retrieve overviews of your terminals and stores, and assign terminals\n    to a merchant account or store.\n\n\n    For more information, refer to [Assign terminals](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/automating-terminal-management/assign-terminals-api).\n\n\n    ## Authentication\n\n    Each request to the Terminal Management API must be signed with an API key. For\n    this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the\n    API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key).\n    Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n\n    ```\n\n    curl\n\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n\n    -H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n\n    ...\n\n    ```\n\n    Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials\n    to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n\n    ## Versioning\n\n    Terminal Management API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning)\n    using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format:\n    \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\n\n    For example:\n\n    ```\n\n    https://postfmapi-test.adyen.com/postfmapi/terminal/v1/getTerminalsUnderAccount\n\n    ```'\n  x-timestamp: '2022-05-03T09:24:09Z'\n  termsOfService: https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions\n  contact:\n    name: Adyen Developer Experience team\n    url: https://www.adyen.help/hc/en-us/community/topics\n    email: developer-experience@adyen.com\nx-groups:\n- General\ntags:\n- name: General\npaths:\n  /assignTerminals:\n    post:\n      tags:\n      - General\n      summary: Assign terminals\n      description: Assigns one or more payment terminals to a merchant account or\n        a store.
