A workflow follows a template. The first one we are adding is the failover template. The failover template instructs the Messages API to first send a message to the specified channel. If that message fails immediately or if the condition_status is not reached within the given time period the next message is sent. The developer will also receive status webhooks from the messages resource for each delivery and read event. This API is currently in Beta.\n  title: Dispatch API\n  version: 0.3.3\n  x-label: Beta\n  x-origin:\n    - format: openapi\n      url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nexmo/api-specification/master/definitions/dispatch.yml\n      version: \"3.0\"\n  x-providerName: nexmo.com\n  x-serviceName: dispatch\npaths:\n  /:\n    post:\n      callbacks:\n        final-report:\n          \"{$request.body#/callback}\":\n            post:\n              description: The final workflow callback is sent when The condition_status was met within the expiry_time. If we take the example API call above. If we received a delivered status at 300 seconds (within the expiry_time) the workflow would be marked as completed. We would not send an SMS. We would then send the final callback. The final message in the failover is delivered. If the message Errors on the last step we will send the final callback. Please note GET is not currently supported. You will notice we have an href to a resource in some of the callbacks. These will fail to load but we wanted to maintain the same structure so that we can seamlessly integrate GET later.\n              operationId: final-report\n              requestBody:\n                content:\n                  application/json:\n                    schema:\n                      $ref: \"#/components/schemas/finalReport\"\n                required: true\n              responses:\n                \"200\":\n                  description: Your server returns this code if it accepts the callback\n              summary: The Final Report\n              x-example-path: /webhooks/final-report\n        message-status:\n          \"{$request.body#/callback}\":\n            post:\n              description: status of the message read or delivered etc.\n              operationId: message-status\n              requestBody:\n                content:\n                  application/json:\n                    schema:\n                      $ref: \"#/components/schemas/MessageStatus\"\n                required: true\n              responses:\n                \"200\":\n                  description: Your server returns this code if it accepts the callback\n              summary: Message Status\n              x-example-path: /webhooks/message-status\n      operationId: createWorkflow\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: \"#/components/schemas/createWorkflow\"\n        description: Please note that last message does not have failover attribute inside it.
