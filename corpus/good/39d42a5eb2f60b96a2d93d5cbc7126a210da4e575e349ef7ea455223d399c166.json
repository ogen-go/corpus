ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information\n    for over 1 million regulated facilities nationwide.\n\n\n    DFR Rest Services provide multiple service endpoints, to retrieve detailed facility location, enforcement, compliance monitoring, and pollutant information for any single facility.  See the Detailed Facility Report (DFR) Help Page (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/detailed-facility-report-help) for additional information on the DFR.  Additionally, a Data Dictionary (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/dfr-data-dictionary) is also available. \n\n    There is one primary service end point, get_dfr, that provides all available DFR data.  All other service end points that are exposed, will return data on a single section of the DFR.    \n     \n    Additional ECHO Resources:   \u003ca href=\"https://echo.epa.gov/tools/web-services\"\u003eWeb Services\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://echo.epa.gov/resources/echo-data/about-the-data\"\u003eAbout ECHO's Data\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads\"\u003eData Downloads\u003c/a\u003e\n  license:\n    name: This page was built with the Swagger API.\n    url: https://swagger.io\n  title: U.S. EPA Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) -
