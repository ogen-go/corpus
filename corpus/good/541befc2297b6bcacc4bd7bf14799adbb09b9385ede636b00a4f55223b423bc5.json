Get your\n    API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key).\n    Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n\n    ```\n\n    curl\n\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n\n    -H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n\n    ...\n\n    ```\n\n    Note that when going live, you need to generate a new API Key to access the [live\n    endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n\n    ## Versioning\n\n    Data Protection Service API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning)\n    using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format:\n    \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\n\n    For example:\n\n    ```\n\n    https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/services/DataProtectionService/v1/requestSubjectErasure\n\n    ```'\n  x-timestamp: '2022-05-03T09:24:04Z'\n  termsOfService: https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions\n  contact:\n    name: Adyen Developer Experience team\n    url: https://www.adyen.help/hc/en-us/community/topics\n    email: developer-experience@adyen.com\nx-groups:\n- General\ntags:\n- name: General\npaths:\n  /requestSubjectErasure:\n    post:\n      tags:\n      - General\n      summary: Submit a Subject Erasure Request.\n      description: Sends the PSP reference containing the shopper data that should\n        be deleted.\n      operationId: post-requestSubjectErasure\n      x-groupName: General\n      x-sortIndex: 0\n      security:\n      - BasicAuth: []\n      - ApiKeyAuth: []\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/SubjectErasureByPspReferenceRequest'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/SubjectErasureResponse'\n          description: OK - the request has succeeded.\n        '400':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ServiceError'\n          description: Bad Request - a problem reading or understanding the request.\n        '401':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ServiceError'\n          description: Unauthorized - authentication required.\n        '403':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ServiceError'\n          description: Forbidden - insufficient permissions to process the request.\n        '422':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ServiceError'\n          description: Unprocessable Entity - a request validation error.\n        '500':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ServiceError'\n          description: Internal Server Error - the server could not process the request.\ncomponents:\n  schemas:\n    ServiceError:\n      properties:\n        errorCode:\n          description: The error code mapped to the error message.\n          type: string\n        errorType:\n          description: The category of the error.\n          type: string\n        message:\n          description: A short explanation of the issue.\n          type: string\n        pspReference:\n          description: The PSP reference of the payment.\n          type: string\n        status:\n          description: The HTTP response status.\n          format: int32\n          type: integer\n    SubjectErasureByPspReferenceRequest:\n      properties:\n        forceErasure:\n          description: Set this to **true** if you want to delete shopper-related\n            data, even if the shopper has an existing recurring transaction.
