If you don't have one, contact our [Adyen Support Team](https://support.adyen.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:\n\n    ```\n    curl\n    -U \"ws@MarketPlace.YourMarketPlace\":\"YourWsPassword\" \\\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    ...\n    ```\n    Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n    ## Versioning\n    The Notification Configuration API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\n    For example:\n    ```\n    https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Notification/v6/createNotificationConfiguration\n    ```\n  termsOfService: https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions\n  title: 'Adyen for Platforms: Notification Configuration API'\n  version: \"6\"\nservers:\n- url: https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Notification/v6\npaths:\n  /createNotificationConfiguration:\n    post:\n      description: Creates a subscription to notifications informing you of events\n        on your platform.
