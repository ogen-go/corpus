You can send a single message or many. Batches are queued and sent at the rate limit in First-In-First-Out order.\n\n      If you want more in-depth knowledge about SMS in general please read the [API Overview](/docs/sms/api-reference/).\n  - name: Inbounds\n    description: Inbounds, or Mobile Originated messages, are incoming messages.

An MSISDN can only occur once in a group and any attempts to add a duplicate are ignored but not rejected.\n  - name: Delivery reports\n    description: \u003e\n      The REST API uses message statuses and error codes in delivery reports, which refer to the state of the SMS batch and can be present in either [Retrieve a delivery report](/docs/sms/api-reference/sms/tag/Delivery-reports/#tag/Delivery-reports/operation/GetDeliveryReportByBatchId) or sent to a [callback](/docs/sms/api-reference/sms/tag/Delivery-reports/#tag/Delivery-reports/paths/deliveryReport/post).\n\n      ### Delivery Report Statuses\n\n      The status field describes which state a particular message is in. Note that statuses of type Intermediate will only be reported if you request a status per recipient ([Retrieve a recipient delivery report](/docs/sms/api-reference/sms/tag/Delivery-reports/#tag/Delivery-reports/operation/GetDeliveryReportByPhoneNumber)), no callback will be made to report them.\n\n      The following statuses are available when using the REST API:\n\n      | Status     | Type         | Description                                                                                                                                   |\n      | ---------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n      | Queued     | Intermediate | Message is queued within REST API system and will be dispatched according to the rate of the account.                                         |\n      | Dispatched | Intermediate | Message has been dispatched and accepted for delivery by the SMSC.                                                                            |\n      | Aborted    | Final        | Message was aborted before reaching the SMSC.                                                                                                 |\n      | Rejected   | Final        | Message was rejected by the SMSC.                                                                                                             |\n      | Deleted    | Final        | Message has been deleted.

The REST API shares most of its error codes with other SMS services.\n\n      In addition to these standard error codes, the REST API provides an additional set of error codes, all within the 4xx range (vendor specific errors in the range of 0x400 to 0x4FF as referenced in the SMPP specification). These are listed below:\n\n      | Status Code (Hex) | Name                         | Status     | Description                                                                                                             |\n      | ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n      | 400               | Queued                       | Queued     | Message is queued within REST API system and will be dispatched according to the rate of the account.                   |\n      | 401               | Dispatched                   | Dispatched | Message has been dispatched to SMSC.                                                                                    |\n      | 402               | Message unroutable           | Aborted    | SMSC rejected message.

The REST API expects the receiving server to respond with a response code within the `2xx` Success range. If no successful response is received, the REST API will either schedule a retry if the error is expected to be temporary or discard the callback if the error seems permanent. The first initial retry will happen 5 seconds after the first try. The next attempt is after 10 seconds, then after 20 seconds, after 40 seconds, after 80 seconds, doubling on every attempt. The last retry will be at 81920 seconds (or 22 hours 45 minutes) after the initial failed attempt.\n\n       The REST API offers the following callback options which can be configured for your account upon request to your account manager.\n\n       - Callback with mutual authentication over TLS (HTTPS) connection by provisioning the callback URL with client keystore and password.\n       - Callback with basic authentication by provisioning the callback URL with username and password.\n       - Callback with OAuth 2.0 by provisioning the callback URL with username, password and the URL to fetch OAuth access token.\n       - Callback using AWS SNS by provisioning the callback URL with an Access Key ID, Secret Key and Region.\n",
