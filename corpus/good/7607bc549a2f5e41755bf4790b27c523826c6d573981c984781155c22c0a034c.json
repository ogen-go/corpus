For example, these include information\n    such as the weights to be used by the Mobile Client in the calculation of the\n    Total Risk Score.\n- name: OTP\n  description: |-\n    The OTP Service provides an API to the National Healthcare Service\n    for authorising OTPs that can be used to upload data from the Mobile Client via\n    the Exposure Ingestion Service. The OTP is generated by the App and communicated\n    by the user to the Healthcare Operator (e.g., during a phone call). The Healthcare\n    Operator inserts the OTP into the HIS, which then registers the OTP on the OTP\n    Service. The OTP automatically expires after a defined interval. If the data have\n    not been uploaded by the time the OTP expires, the user will have to restart the\n    process with a new OTP.\n- name: Exposure Ingestion\n  description: |-\n    The Exposure Ingestion Service provides an API for the Mobile Client\n    to upload its TEKs for the previous 14 days, in the case that the user tests positive\n    for SARS-CoV-2 and decides to share them. Contextually, the Mobile Client uploads\n    the Epidemiological Infos from the previous 14 days, if any. If some Epidemiological\n    Infos are indeed uploaded, the user's Province of Domicile is uploaded too. The\n    upload can only take place with an authorised OTP. The Exposure Ingestion Service\n    is also responsible for periodically generating the TEK Chunks to be published\n    by the Exposure Reporting Service. The TEK Chunks are assigned a unique incremental\n    index and are immutable. They are generated periodically as the Mobile Clients\n    upload new TEKs. TEK Chunks older than 14 days are automatically deleted from\n    the database by an async cleanup job. Province of Domicile and Epidemiological\n    Infos are forwarded to the Analytics Service.\n- name: Exposure Reporting\n  description: |-\n    The Exposure Reporting Service makes the TEK Chunks created by the\n    Exposure Ingestion Service available to the Mobile Client. Only TEK Chunks for\n    the last 14 days are made available. To avoid downloading the same TEKs multiple\n    times, the Mobile Clients fetch the indexes of the TEK Chunks available to download\n    first. Then, they only actually download TEK Chunks with indexes for which TEK\n    Chunks have not been downloaded before.\n- name: Analytics\n  description: |-\n    The Analytics Service provides an API to the Mobile Clients for uploading\n    certain data without identifying users, both during regular operations and especially\n    when a match is found between a TEK Chunk and the RPIs in the RPI Database. Collecting\n    these data is crucial to spotting anomalies in the system, as well as being able\n    to check how many users are being notified. The National Healthcare System needs\n    this information to operate Immuni effectively.\npaths:\n  /settings:\n    get:\n      tags:\n      - App Configuration\n      summary: \u003e-\n        The Mobile Client fetches the Configuration Settings.
