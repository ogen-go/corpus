To help\n    us streamline the review of abuse reports, you acknowledge and agree that\n    your use of GoDaddy’s Abuse API is subject to the following quality metrics\n    and terms of use.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGoDaddy may, in its sole and absolute discretion,\n    change or modify these terms, and such changes or modifications shall be\n    effective immediately upon notice to you. Your use of GoDaddy’s Abuse API\n    after such changes or modifications shall constitute your acceptance of\n    these terms as last revised. If you do not agree to be bound by these terms\n    as last revised, do not use (or continue to use) our Abuse API.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs an\n    Abuse API user, you must only submit abuse reports via the API portal and\n    cease all email submissions, including but not limited, to\n    phishing@godaddy.com, netabuse@godaddy.com, malware@godaddy.com, or\n    spam@godaddy.com, etc.  Any additional or duplicate submission outside of\n    the API portal will be deprioritized for review. Submissions related to\n    trademark, copyright or content issues may still be sent to\n    trademarkclaims@godaddy.com, coyprightclaims@godaddy.com, and\n    contentcomplaints@godaddy.com, respectively. Our [Front of\n    Site](https://supportcenter.godaddy.com/AbuseReport) also describes other\n    scenarios not covered by the API.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you submit abuse reports via\n    GoDaddy’s Abuse API, you must ensure that you accurately categorize the\n    abuse type of each report to match our definitions in the API documentations\n    provided to you. Any submission that fails to match our definitions or is\n    miscategorized will be marked as a false positive. Examples include, but are\n    not limited to, submissions of trademark complaints marked as phishing or\n    malware, or submissions of copyright complaints marked as phishing or\n    malware, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf, at any time, the false positive rate of submissions\n    exceeds 40% of your total submissions, as determined by GoDaddy, GoDaddy may\n    in its sole discretion deprioritize any subsequent reports submitted by you\n    and/or your organization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou acknowledge and agree that submitting\n    every URL for a single domain is not necessary and will not expedite the\n    review process. If your submissions exceed five (5) URLs for a single\n    domain, your report will be marked as a duplicate submission taking into\n    account that the final outcome of such submissions would yield the same\n    result as the original report. GoDaddy may in its sole discretion\n    deprioritize reports submitted by you and/or your organization in the event\n    more than 20% of your submissions are classified as duplicate\n    submissions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou further acknowledge and agree that our Customer\n    Support lines are not intended to address abuse reporting matters or your\n    use of GoDaddy’s Abuse API.
