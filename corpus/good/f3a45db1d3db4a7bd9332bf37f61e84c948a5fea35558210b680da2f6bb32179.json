These related entities include account holders,\n    accounts, bank accounts, shareholders, and KYC-related documents. The\n    management operations include actions such as creation, retrieval, updating,\n    and deletion of them.\n\n\n    For further information on MarketPay API, visit the [MarketPay documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/marketpay/marketpay-overview).\n\n    ## Authentication\n\n    To connect to the MarketPay API, you must use basic authentication credentials of your web service user. If you don't have one, please contact the [Adyen Support Team](https://support.adyen.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:\n\n\n    ```\n\n    curl\n\n    -U \"ws@Company.YourCompany\":\"YourWsPassword\" \\\n\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n\n    ...\n\n    ```\n\n    Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/api-reference/live-endpoints).\n\n\n    ## Versioning\n\n    MarketPay API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\n\n    For example:\n\n    ```\n\n    https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Account/v4/createAccountHolder\n\n    ```\n  termsOfService: https://docs.adyen.com/legal/terms-conditions\n  title: Adyen MarketPay Account Service\n  version: \"4\"\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    - payment\n  x-logo:\n    url: https://twitter.com/Adyen/profile_image?size=original\n  x-origin:\n    - converter:\n        url: https://github.com/lucybot/api-spec-converter\n        version: 2.7.11\n      format: openapi\n      url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adyen/adyen-openapi/master/specs/3.0/AccountService-v4.json\n      version: \"3.0\"\n  x-preferred: true\n  x-providerName: adyen.com\n  x-serviceName: AccountService\npaths:\n  /closeAccount:\n    post:\n      description: This endpoint is used to close an existing account under an account\n        holder.
