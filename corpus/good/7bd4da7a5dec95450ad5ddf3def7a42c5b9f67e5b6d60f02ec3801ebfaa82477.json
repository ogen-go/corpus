The API will generate a password reset code which the admin should then provide to the user. The user can use their client to reset their password. Normally the password reset code is mailed to the user, but I didn't want to do this in this case because I didn't want to  introduce the complicated dependency of having an SMTP server just for this purpose. Doing it this way makes it easy for people to adopt this  API.\n      requestBody:\n        $ref: \"#/components/requestBodies/requestPasswordResetPayload\"\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/requestPasswordResetResponse\"\n          description: Success\n        \"401\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/Unauthorized\"\n      summary: Used for requesting a password reset code\n      tags:\n        - Passwords\n  /signin:\n    post:\n      description: Create a new signin record\n      requestBody:\n        $ref: \"#/components/requestBodies/signinPayload\"\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/signinResponse\"\n          description: Success\n        \"401\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/Unauthorized\"\n        \"503\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/KeyFailure\"\n      tags:\n        - Attendees signins\n  \"/signin/{signinId}\":\n    delete:\n      description: |\n        Delete a signin record      \n      parameters:\n        - description: The ID of the signin record to be deleted.\n          in: path\n          name: signinId\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            example: 1\n            type: integer\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: Success\n        \"401\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/Unauthorized\"\n      summary: Delete a signin record\n      tags:\n        - Attendees signins\n    get:\n      description: |\n        Retrieve the information associated with a signin record\n      parameters:\n        - description: The ID of the signin record to be retrieved.\n          in: path\n          name: signinId\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            example: 1\n            type: integer\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/signin\"\n          description: Success\n        \"401\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/Unauthorized\"\n      summary: Retrieve the information associated with a signin record\n      tags:\n        - Attendees signins\n    put:\n      description: |\n        Update a signin record\n      parameters:\n        - description: The ID of the signin record to be retrieved.\n          in: path\n          name: signinId\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            example: 1\n            type: integer\n      requestBody:\n        $ref: \"#/components/requestBodies/signinPayload\"\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/userRecord\"\n          description: Success\n        \"401\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/Unauthorized\"\n      summary: Update a signin record\n      tags:\n        - Attendees signins\n  /signins:\n    get:\n      description: Returns a list of signin objects sorted by signin ID descending.\n      parameters:\n        - description: Return signins with IDs less than this value.\n          in: query\n          name: less_than\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            type: integer\n        - description: Return this many objects\n          in: query\n          name: return_count\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            default: 100\n            maximum: 100\n            minimum: 1\n            type: integer\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                items:\n                  $ref: \"#/components/schemas/signin\"\n                type: array\n          description: Successful response\n        \"401\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/Unauthorized\"\n        \"503\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/KeyFailure\"\n      summary: Get signin info\n      tags:\n        - Attendees signins\n  /user:\n    post:\n      description: Use this endpoint to create a team member (user) record\n      requestBody:\n        $ref: \"#/components/requestBodies/createUserPayload\"\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/createUserResponse\"\n          description: Success\n        \"401\":\n          $ref: \"#/components/responses/Unauthorized\"\n      summary: Create a user\n      tags:\n        - Team Members\n  \"/user/{userId}\":\n    delete:\n      description: |\n        To preserve referential integrity in the database, the user account  will not be deleted from the database.
