A\n        Query object consists of a required Message object with optional\n        additional properties. Additional properties are intended to convey\n        implementation-specific or query-independent parameters. For example,\n        an additional property specifying a log level could allow a user to\n        override the default log level in order to receive more fine-grained\n        log information when debugging an issue.\n      x-body-name: request_body\n      type: object\n      properties:\n        message:\n          allOf:\n            - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Message'\n          description: \u003e-\n            The query Message is a serialization of the user request. Content\n            of the Message object depends on the intended TRAPI operation. For\n            example, the fill operation requires a non-empty query_graph field\n            as part of the Message, whereas other operations, e.g. overlay,\n            require non-empty results and knowledge_graph fields.\n        bypass_cache:\n          type: string\n          example: 'true'\n          description: \u003e-\n            Set to true in order to bypass any possible cached message and try to\n            answer the query over again\n        asynchronous:\n          type: string\n          example: 'false'\n          description: \u003e-\n            Set to true in order to receive an incomplete message_id if the query\n            will take a while.
