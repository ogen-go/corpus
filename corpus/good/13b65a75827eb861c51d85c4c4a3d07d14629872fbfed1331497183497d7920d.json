It is public and free to use. There are currently no usage limits or restrictions, but please use common sense when using the API and don't do anything that would cause too much traffic for the server. All usage is tracked, and we reserve the right to block anything that we consider abusive!\n    \n    # Attribution Requirement\n    If you use the API in a public manner, you are required to give ROM Exchange credit by providing a clearly visible link to [romexchange.com](https://www.romexchange.com) on whatever tool is using the API. A good example is how [ROGuard](https://www.roguard.net/db/items/12308/) uses and attributes ROM Exchange.\n    \n    # Recent Changes\n    When integrating this API with your tool, please keep in mind that the request and response are not guaranteed to stay the same in the future, but we will do our best to ensure any changes would not break the majority of integrations that we know about.\n    - **Mar 9, 2019**\n      - **Breaking change:** `sort_range` query parameter has been renamed to `range`. Data from every time range (all, month, and week) will no longer be returned all at the same time. Only data from one time range will be returned with each call, determined by the `range` query parameter. The default is `week`.\n    - **Feb 22, 2019**\n      - Added fuzzy search fallback, and `autocorrect_accuracy` added to response if fuzzy search used\n      - Added `items.json` request to get all items\n    - **Feb 21, 2019**\n      - Added `slim` query parameter\n      - Added `latest_time` to response\n    \n    \nexternalDocs:\n  description: 'Issues, support, and feedback: https://github.com/JessicaYeh/rom-exchange-web/issues'\n  url: 'https://github.com/JessicaYeh/rom-exchange-web/issues'\n\n# A list of tags used by the specification with additional metadata.\n# The order of the tags can be used to reflect on their order by the parsing tools.\ntags:\n  - name: Item\nservers:\n  - url: 'https://www.romexchange.com/api'\n\n# Holds the relative paths to the individual endpoints.

To search for multiple items at once, separate each item name with a pipe character, i.e. `elunium|oridecon`. If searching for multiple items, the `exact` parameter has no effect, but is forced to `true`.\n          example: Shining Stone\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - name: exact\n          in: query\n          description: Specify whether the search should look for a single item name that matches the `item` parameter exactly (case insensitive) or should look for any item name that contains `item` parameter.\n          example: false\n          schema:\n            type: boolean\n            default: true\n        - name: slim\n          in: query\n          description: When set to `true`, every `data` array will be removed, to reduce the size of the returned JSON payload.\n          schema:\n            type: boolean\n            default: false\n        - name: type\n          in: query\n          description: Filter to items that match this type.\n            1 Weapons,\n            2 Off-hand,\n            3 Armors,\n            4 Garments,\n            5 Footgears,\n            6 Accessory,\n            7 Blueprint,\n            8 Potion / Effect,\n            9 Refine,\n            10 Scroll / Album,\n            11 Material,\n            12 Holiday material,\n            13 Pet material,\n            14 Premium,\n            15 Costume,\n            16 Head,\n            17 Face,\n            18 Back,\n            19 Mouth,\n            20 Tail,\n            21 Weapon card,\n            22 Off-hand card,\n            23 Armor card,\n            24 Garments card,\n            25 Shoe card,\n            26 Accessory card,\n            27 Headwear card\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ItemType'\n        - name: sort\n          in: query\n          description: Specify how the results should be sorted.
