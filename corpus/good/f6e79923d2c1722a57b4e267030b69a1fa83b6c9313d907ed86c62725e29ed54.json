You can use the same integration for payments made with cards (including One-Click and 3D Secure), mobile wallets, and local payment methods (e.g. iDEAL and Sofort).\n\n    This API reference provides information on available endpoints and how to interact with them. To learn more about the API, visit [Checkout documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/checkout).\n\n    ## Authentication\n    Each request to the Checkout API must be signed with an API key. For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n    ```\n    curl\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -H \"X-API-Key: Your_Checkout_API_key\" \\\n    ...\n    ```\n    Note that when going live, you need to generate a new API Key to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n    ## Versioning\n    Checkout API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\n    For example:\n    ```\n    https://checkout-test.adyen.com/v37/payments\n    ```\n  termsOfService: 'https://docs.adyen.com/legal/terms-conditions'\n  title: Adyen Checkout Service\n  version: '37'\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    - payment\n  x-logo:\n    url: 'https://twitter.com/Adyen/profile_image?size=original'\n  x-origin:\n    - converter:\n        url: 'https://github.com/lucybot/api-spec-converter'\n        version: 2.7.18\n      format: openapi\n      url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adyen/adyen-openapi/master/specs/3.0/CheckoutService-v37.json'\n      version: '3.0'\n  x-preferred: false\n  x-providerName: adyen.com\n  x-serviceName: CheckoutService\npaths:\n  /paymentMethods:\n    post:\n      description: |-\n        Queries the available payment methods for a transaction based on the transaction context (like amount, country, and currency). Besides giving back a list of the available payment methods, the response also returns which input details you need to collect from the shopper (to be submitted to `/payments`).\n\n        Although we highly recommend using this endpoint to ensure you are always offering the most up-to-date list of payment methods, its usage is optional. You can, for example, also cache the `/paymentMethods` response and update it once a week.\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/PaymentMethodsRequest'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/PaymentMethodsResponse'\n          description: OK - the request has succeeded.\n        '400':\n          description: Bad Request - a problem reading or understanding the request.\n        '401':\n          description: Unauthorized - authentication required.\n        '403':\n          description: Forbidden - insufficient permissions to process the request.\n        '422':\n          description: Unprocessable Entity - a request validation error.\n        '500':\n          description: Internal Server Error - the server could not process the request.\n      summary: Returns available payment methods.\n      x-groupName: API Integration\n      x-sortIndex: 1\n  /paymentSession:\n    post:\n      description: |-\n        Provides the data object that can be used to start the Checkout SDK.

When sending in the request to `/payments/details`, make sure you send the corresponding `paymentData` as obtained during the `/payments` call.\n\n        In addition, the endpoint can be used to verify a `payload`, which is returned after coming back from the Checkout SDK or any of the redirect based methods on the Checkout API.\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/DetailsRequest'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/PaymentResponse'\n          description: OK - the request has succeeded.\n        '400':\n          description: Bad Request - a problem reading or understanding the request.\n        '401':\n          description: Unauthorized - authentication required.\n        '403':\n          description: Forbidden - insufficient permissions to process the request.\n        '422':\n          description: Unprocessable Entity - a request validation error.\n        '500':\n          description: Internal Server Error - the server could not process the request.\n      summary: Submits details for a payment.\n      x-groupName: API Integration\n      x-sortIndex: 3\n  /payments/result:\n    post:\n      description: |-\n        Verifies the payment result using the payload returned from the Checkout SDK.\n\n        For more information, refer to [How it works](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/checkout/integrations-overview#howitworks).\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/PaymentVerificationRequest'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/PaymentVerificationResponse'\n          description: OK - the request has succeeded.\n        '400':\n          description: Bad Request - a problem reading or understanding the request.\n        '401':\n          description: Unauthorized - authentication required.\n        '403':\n          description: Forbidden - insufficient permissions to process the request.\n        '422':\n          description: Unprocessable Entity - a request validation error.\n        '500':\n          description: Internal Server Error - the server could not process the request.\n      summary: Verifies payment result.\n      x-groupName: SDK Integration\n      x-sortIndex: 2\ncomponents:\n  schemas:\n    Address:\n      properties:\n        city:\n          description: |-\n            The name of the city.\n            \u003eRequired if either houseNumberOrName, street, postalCode, or stateOrProvince are provided.\n          type: string\n        country:\n          description: |-\n            The two-character country code of the address\n            \u003eThe permitted country codes are defined in ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 (e.g. 'NL').\n          type: string\n        houseNumberOrName:\n          description: The number or name of the house.\n          type: string\n        postalCode:\n          description: |-\n            The postal code.\n            \u003eA maximum of five (5) digits for an address in the USA, or a maximum of ten (10) characters for an address in all other countries.\n            \u003eRequired if either houseNumberOrName, street, city, or stateOrProvince are provided.\n          type: string\n        stateOrProvince:\n          description: |-\n            The abbreviation of the state or province.\n            \u003eTwo (2) characters for an address in the USA or Canada, or a maximum of three (3) characters for an address in all other countries.\n            \u003eRequired for an address in the USA or Canada if either houseNumberOrName, street, city, or postalCode are provided.\n          type: string\n        street:\n          description: |-\n            The name of the street.\n            \u003eThe house number should not be included in this field;
