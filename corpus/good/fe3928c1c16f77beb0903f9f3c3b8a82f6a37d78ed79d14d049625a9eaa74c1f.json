Only one permission can be granted per parameter. To assign more than one permission, repeat this parameter for each permission value. Note that the update action replaces all previously assigned permissions with those defined in the update action. To remove a permission, do not include it in the subsequent update action. The values for this parameter depend on the role's `type`.\n                  items:\n                    type: string\n                  type: array\n              required:\n                - Permission\n              title: UpdateServiceRoleRequest\n              type: object\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/conversations.v1.service.service_role\"\n          description: OK\n      security:\n        - accountSid_authToken: []\n      x-maturity:\n        - GA\n    servers:\n      - url: https://conversations.twilio.com\n    x-twilio:\n      defaultOutputProperties:\n        - sid\n        - friendly_name\n        - type\n      parent: /Services\n      pathType: instance\n  \"/v1/Services/{ChatServiceSid}/Users\":\n    description: A Service User resource represents a conversation user belonging to a specific conversation service.\n    get:\n      description: Retrieve a list of all conversation users in your service\n      operationId: ListServiceUser\n      parameters:\n        - description: The SID of the [Conversation Service](https://www.twilio.com/docs/conversations/api/service-resource) to read the User resources from.\n          in: path\n          name: ChatServiceSid\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            maxLength: 34\n            minLength: 34\n            pattern: ^IS[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$\n            type: string\n        - description: How many resources to return in each list page.
