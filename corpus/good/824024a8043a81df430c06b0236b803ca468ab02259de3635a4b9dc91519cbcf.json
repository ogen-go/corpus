For example, to map a data field with\n            the key/value of “gender=female” to the key/value of 'G=F',\n            'Pets=Dogs' to 'Pets in Household=Dogs'.\n\n\n            Note: If you need to pass the input key/value data without any\n            transformation, you still need to create entries for those keys in\n            this array. For example, to pass all values of key 'country' without\n            any transformation, do not set 'value' in both the input and output\n            key/value parameters.\n\n\n            Note: This array can only accept upto 500 entries.
