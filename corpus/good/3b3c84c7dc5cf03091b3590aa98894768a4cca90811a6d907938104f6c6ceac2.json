Count and frequency data were derived from the [Columbia University Medical Center's](http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/) [OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org/) database including inpatient and outpatient data. Counts are the number of patients associated with the concept, e.g., diagnosed with a condition, exposed to a drug, or who had a procedure. Frequencies are the number of patients associated with the concept divided by the total number of patients in the dataset, i.e., prevalence in the electronic health records. To protect patient privacy, all concepts and pairs of concepts where the count \u003c= 10 were excluded, and counts were randomized by the Poisson distribution. \n    \n    Two datasets are available: \n    1) 5-year dataset: includes clinical data from 2013-2017  \n    2) lifetime dataset: includes clinical data from all dates  \n    \n    While the lifetime dataset captures a larger patient population and range of concepts, the 5-year dataset has better underlying data consistency. \n    \n    Clinical concepts (e.g., conditions, procedures, drugs) are coded by their standard concept ID in the [OMOP Common Data Model](https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/wiki). API methods are provided to map to/from other vocabularies supported in OMOP and other ontologies using the EMBL-EBI Ontology Xref Service (OxO). \n\n\n    The following resources are available through this API: \n\n\n    1. Metadata: Metadata on the COHD database, including dataset descriptions, number of concepts, etc. \n\n\n    2. OMOP: access to the common vocabulary for name and concept identifier mapping\n\n\n    3. Clinical Frequencies: access to the counts and frequencies of conditions, procedures, and drug exposures, and the associations between them. Frequency was determined as the number of patients with the code(s) / total number of patients. \n\n\n    4. Concept Associations: Inferred associations between concepts using chi-square analysis, ratio between observed to expected frequency, and relative frequency. \n\n\n    COHD was developed at the [Columbia University Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/) as a collaboration between the [Weng Lab](http://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~chw7007/), [Tatonetti Lab](http://tatonettilab.org/), and the [NCATS Biomedical Data Translator](https://ncats.nih.gov/translator) program (Red Team).
