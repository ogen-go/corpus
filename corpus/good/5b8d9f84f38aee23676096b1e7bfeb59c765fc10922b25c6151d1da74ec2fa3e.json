What is more, it's possible to specify different source account for different operation. This can be used to implement features like over-the-counter exchange (include into transaction two operations: one sending assets from A to B; one sending assets from B to A; such transaction requires signatures from both A and B).\n  - name: Accounts\n    description: Defines operations to manage Accounts\n  - name: Balances\n    description: Defines operations to manage Balances\n  - name: Assets\n    description: Defines operations to manage Assets\n  - name: Fees\n    description: Defines operations to manage Fees\n  - name: Signers\n    description: Defines operations to manage Signers\n  - name: Account Roles\n    description: Account Role - entry that consists of [Account Rules](#tag/Account-Rules) and can be attached to account.\n  - name: Account Rules\n    description: |\n      Account Rule defines if `action` can be performed for [resource](#operation/AccountRuleResource).\n\n      TokenD uses strict policy for rules matching.\n      List of requirements to the roles of participants is formed based on operation (transaction) details.\n      If one of the requirements is not fulfilled, operation is rejected.\n      Requirement is specified for account and consits of resource and action to be performed.\n      Requirement is fulfilled if account's role contains matching rule with `forbids=false`.\n      If one of the matching rules has `forbids=true` - operation is rejected.\n      If role does not contain any matching rules - operation is rejected.\n  - name: Signer Roles\n    description: Signer Role - entry that consists of [Signer Rules](#tag/Signer-Rules) and can be attached to signer.\n  - name: Signer Rules\n    description: |\n      Signer Rule - entry that defines if `action` can be performed for [resource](#operation/SignerRuleResource).\n\n      TokenD uses strict policy for rules matching.\n      List of requirements to the roles of participants is formed based on operation (transaction) details.\n      If one of the requirements is not fulfilled, operation is rejected.\n      Requirement is specified for signer and consits of resource and action to be performed.\n      Requirement is fulfilled if signer's role contains matching rule with `forbids=false`.\n      If one of the matching rules has `forbids=true` - operation is rejected.\n      If role does not contain any matching rules - operation is rejected.\n  - name: Asset Pairs\n    description: |\n\n  - name: Order Books\n    description: |\n\n  - name: AMLAlert\n    description: Defines access points to AMLAlert Reviewable Requests\n  - name: KYC\n    description: Defines access points to Change Role Reviewable Requests\n  - name: Issuance\n    description: Defines access points to get Issuance Reviewable Requests\n  - name: Withdrawal\n    description: Defines access points to get Withdrawal Reviewable Requests\n  - name: Payment\n    description: Defines access points to get Payments\n  - name: Sale\n    description: Defines access points to get operations related to sales\n  - name: External Systems\n    descriptions: Defines access points to get operations related to external systems\n  - name: Polls\n    description: Defines access points to operations related to polls\n  - name: Votes\n    description: Defines access points to operations related to votes\n  - name: Account Specific Rules\n    description: |\n      `Account Specific Rules` are similar in functionality to `Account Rules` - they define permissions to interact with various TokenD entities on account level. The main difference between `Account Specific Rules` and `Account Rules` is that with `Account Specific Rules` it's possible to define permissions for particular account without need to create separate role for this account. What is more, `Account Specific Rules` are managed by both Admins and entry owners.\n      Main use case for this feature is white/black lists for particular entity. In current version it's only possible to manage white/black lists for sales.\nx-tagGroups:\n  - name: Essentials\n    tags:\n      - Transaction\n      - Accounts\n      - Assets\n      - Payment\n  - name: Asset Movements\n    tags:\n     - Issuance\n     - Withdrawal\n     - Payment\n     - Balances\n     - Fees\n     - External Systems\n     - Atomic Swap\n     - Redemption\n     - Deferred payment\n  - name: Access Control\n    tags:\n      - Signers\n      - Signer Roles\n      - Signer Rules\n  - name: KYC \u0026 AML\n    tags:\n      - Account Roles\n      - Account Rules\n      - Account Specific Rules\n      - KYC\n      - AMLAlert\n      - Limits\n      - Create Manage Limits Request\n  - name: Decentralized Exchange\n    tags:\n      - Asset Pairs\n      - Offers\n      - Order Books\n      - Crowd Investing\n      - Sale\n  - name: Advanced\n    tags:\n      - PreIssuance\n      - KeyValue\n  - name: Other\n    tags:\n      - Requests\n      - Licensing\n      - WIP\n  - name: Voting\n    tags:\n      - Polls\n      - Votes\n  - name: Data\n    tags:\n      - Data\n",
