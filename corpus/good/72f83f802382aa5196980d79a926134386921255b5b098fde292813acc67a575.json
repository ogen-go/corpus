That includes SNMP-related and OS process related information.\n\n\n    The data is provided by running SNMP Simulator supervisor(s) and SNMP\n    Simulator processes, metrics REST API is essentially read-only.\n\n\n    Although reported counters are designed as ever growing, the consumer\n    should be prepared to handle the situation when the counters are reset\n    to zero abruptly (likely on REST API DB respin).\n\n\n    **OS process metrics**\n\n\n    SNMP Simulator instances are invoked, teared down and looked after by\n    one or more `supervisor` processes. The `/supervisors` endpoint reveals\n    some basic runtime information on each of the running supervisors.\n\n    The `/processes` endpoint exposes the details on SNMP Simulator processes\n    resource consumption, overall health and lifecycle.\n\n    Also linked from each process object, `/endpoints/\u003cid\u003e` reports local\n    network ports being allocated by each SNMP Simulator process.\n\n    Finally, `/process/\u003cid\u003e/console` lists virtual console pages of the\n    process. Each page is a wall of text of up to a fixed size (80*24\n    characters), as appeared on process's stdout and stderr at a point of time\n    identified by an accompanying timestamp. Older console pages automatically\n    expire.\n\n\n    **SNMP activity metrics**\n\n\n    The `/activity` endpoints report SNMP traffic counters optionally filtered\n    by one or more attributes. Conceptually, any SNMP command traverses simulator\n    subsystems in order\n\n    1. network transport\n\n    2. agent\n\n    3. recording\n\n    4. variation module\n\n\n    Each subsystem extract certain attributes from the passing traffic by\n    which `/activity/packets` and `/activity/messages` endpoints can filter\n    reported counters.\n\n\n    Available filters applicable to specific endpoint can be discovered via\n    `/activity/{packets, messages}/filters` endpoint.\n\n\n    For example, user can get packet count for all agents or for a single\n    specific agent, for agent+endpoint combination (an agent can listen on\n    multiple endpoints) or for agent+recording pair (any single recording can\n    be used by many agents).\n\n\n    The consumer of `/activity/*` endpoints is expected to poll the API\n    periodically pushing collected data into a time-series database for\n    dynamics computing and data aggregation.\n\nservers:\n  - url: https://virtserver.swaggerhub.com/etingof/snmpsim-metrics/1.0.0\n  - url: http://127.0.0.1:5001/snmpsim/metrics/v1\n\npaths:\n  /activity/packets:\n    get:\n      description: \u003e\n        Activity report for a selection of network transport.
