Notifications are sent upon the occurrence of certain events (such as a KYC check completion or a payout completion), and the subscription to these notifications dictates to where they are sent.\n\n    For further information on MarketPay notifications, please visit the [MarketPay documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/marketpay/marketpay-overview).\n    ## Authentication\n    To connect to the MarketPay API, you must use basic authentication credentials of your web service user. If you don't have one, please contact the [Adyen Support Team](https://support.adyen.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:\n\n    ```\n    curl\n    -U \"ws@Company.YourCompany\":\"YourWsPassword\" \\\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    ...\n    ```\n    Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/api-reference/live-endpoints).\n\n    ## Versioning\n    MarketPay API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\n    For example:\n    ```\n    https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Notification/v1/createNotificationConfiguration\n    ```\n  termsOfService: 'https://docs.adyen.com/legal/terms-conditions'\n  title: Adyen MarketPay Notification Configuration Service\n  version: '1'\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    - payment\n  x-logo:\n    url: 'https://twitter.com/Adyen/profile_image?size=original'\n  x-origin:\n    - converter:\n        url: 'https://github.com/lucybot/api-spec-converter'\n        version: 2.7.11\n      format: openapi\n      url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adyen/adyen-openapi/master/specs/3.0/NotificationConfigurationService-v1.json'\n      version: '3.0'\n  x-providerName: adyen.com\n  x-serviceName: NotificationConfigurationService\npaths:\n  /createNotificationConfiguration:\n    post:\n      description: 'This endpoint is used to create a subscription to MarketPay event notifications.
