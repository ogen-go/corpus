While the counts\n    are broken up by 15 minute intervals, the data is currently loaded only once\n    per day.  We are hoping to increase this frequency to at least once every\n    hour. The LOOP_ID field is common to both datasets and can be used to\n    cross-reference them.\n  license:\n    name: Open Government License - British Columbia\n    url: http://www.data.gov.bc.ca/local/dbc/docs/license/OGL-vbc2.0.pdf\n  termsOfService: http://www.data.gov.bc.ca/local/dbc/docs/license/API_Terms_of_Use.pdf\n  title: City of Surrey Traffic Loop Count API.\n  version: \"0.1\"\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    - open_data\n  x-logo:\n    url: https://twitter.com/CityofSurrey/profile_image?size=original\n  x-origin:\n    - format: swagger\n      url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cityofsurrey/traffic-loops-api/master/surrey-trafficloop.json\n      version: \"2.0\"\n  x-providerName: surrey.ca\n  x-serviceName: trafficloops\ntags:\n  - name: traffic\n  - name: count\n  - name: induction\n  - name: volume\n  - name: intersection\n  - name: transportation\npaths:\n  /TrafficLoopCounts.fmw:\n    get:\n      description: Provides traffic loop counts for the input time interval.
