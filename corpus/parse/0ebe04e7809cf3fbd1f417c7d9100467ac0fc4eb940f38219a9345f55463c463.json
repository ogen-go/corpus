For transaction history from investments accounts, use the [Investments endpoint](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/) instead. Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.\n\n        Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).\n\n        Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.\n\n        Data returned by `/transactions/get` will be the data available for the Item as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. An Item's `status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.\n\n        Note that data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to `/transactions/get`, if it wasn't. To be alerted when transaction data is ready to be fetched, listen for the [`INITIAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#initial_update) and [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhooks. If no transaction history is ready when `/transactions/get` is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/TransactionsGetRequest'\n            examples: {}\n  /transactions/refresh:\n    post:\n      tags:\n      - plaid\n      summary: Refresh transaction data\n      externalDocs:\n        url: /api/products/transactions/#transactionsrefresh\n      operationId: transactionsRefresh\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: OK\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/TransactionsRefreshResponse'\n              examples:\n                example-1:\n                  value:\n                    request_id: 1vwmF5TBQwiqfwP\n        default:\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Error'\n          description: Error response\n      description: |-\n        `/transactions/refresh` is an optional endpoint for users of the Transactions product. It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for an Item. This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur multiple times a day for any Transactions-enabled Item. If changes to transactions are discovered after calling `/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling `/transactions/get`.\n\n        Access to `/transactions/refresh` in Production is specific to certain pricing plans.

Plaid will only return active bank accounts — that is, accounts that are not closed and are capable of carrying a balance.\n        For items that went through the updated account selection pane, this endpoint only returns accounts that were permissioned by the user when they initially created the Item. If a user creates a new account after the initial link, you can capture this event through the [`NEW_ACCOUNTS_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/items/#new_accounts_available) webhook and then use Link's [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode/) to request that the user share this new account with you.\n\n        This endpoint retrieves cached information, rather than extracting fresh information from the institution. As a result, balances returned may not be up-to-date; for realtime balance information, use `/accounts/balance/get` instead. Note that some information is nullable.\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: success\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/AccountsGetResponse'\n              examples:\n                example-1:\n                  value:\n                    accounts:\n                    - account_id: blgvvBlXw3cq5GMPwqB6s6q4dLKB9WcVqGDGo\n                      balances:\n                        available: 100\n                        current: 110\n                        iso_currency_code: USD\n                        limit: null\n                        unofficial_currency_code: null\n                      mask: \"0000\"\n                      name: Plaid Checking\n                      official_name: Plaid Gold Standard 0% Interest Checking\n                      subtype: checking\n                      type: depository\n                    - account_id: 6PdjjRP6LmugpBy5NgQvUqpRXMWxzktg3rwrk\n                      balances:\n                        available: null\n                        current: 23631.9805\n                        iso_currency_code: USD\n                        limit: null\n                        unofficial_currency_code: null\n                      mask: \"6666\"\n                      name: Plaid 401k\n                      official_name: null\n                      subtype: 401k\n                      type: investment\n                    - account_id: XMBvvyMGQ1UoLbKByoMqH3nXMj84ALSdE5B58\n                      balances:\n                        available: null\n                        current: 65262\n                        iso_currency_code: USD\n                        limit: null\n                        unofficial_currency_code: null\n                      mask: \"7777\"\n                      name: Plaid Student Loan\n                      official_name: null\n                      subtype: student\n                      type: loan\n                    item:\n                      available_products:\n                      - balance\n                      - identity\n                      - payment_initiation\n                      - transactions\n                      billed_products:\n                      - assets\n                      - auth\n                      consent_expiration_time: null\n                      error: null\n                      institution_id: ins_117650\n                      item_id: DWVAAPWq4RHGlEaNyGKRTAnPLaEmo8Cvq7na6\n                      update_type: background\n                      webhook: https://www.genericwebhookurl.com/webhook\n                    request_id: bkVE1BHWMAZ9Rnr\n        default:\n          description: Error response.\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Error'\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/AccountsGetRequest'\n            examples:\n              example-1:\n                value:\n                  client_id: string\n                  secret: string\n                  access_token: string\n                  options:\n                    account_ids:\n                    - string\n  /categories/get:\n    post:\n      security: []\n      tags:\n      - plaid\n      summary: Get Categories\n      externalDocs:\n        url: /api/products/transactions/#categoriesget\n      operationId: categoriesGet\n      description: Send a request to the `/categories/get` endpoint to get detailed information on categories returned by Plaid.

Liabilities data is available primarily for US financial institutions, with some limited coverage of Canadian institutions. Currently supported account types are account type `credit` with account subtype `credit card` or `paypal`, and account type `loan` with account subtype `student` or `mortgage`. To limit accounts listed in Link to types and subtypes supported by Liabilities, you can use the `account_filters` parameter when [creating a Link token](https://plaid.com/docs/api/tokens/#linktokencreate).\n\n        The types of information returned by Liabilities can include balances and due dates, loan terms, and account details such as original loan amount and guarantor. Data is refreshed approximately once per day; the latest data can be retrieved by calling `/liabilities/get`.\n\n        Note: This request may take some time to complete if `liabilities` was not specified as an initial product when creating the Item. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to retrieve the additional data.\n  /payment_initiation/recipient/create:\n    post:\n      tags:\n      - plaid\n      summary: Create payment recipient\n      externalDocs:\n        url: /api/products/payment-initiation/#payment_initiationrecipientcreate\n      operationId: paymentInitiationRecipientCreate\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: OK\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/PaymentInitiationRecipientCreateResponse'\n              examples:\n                example-1:\n                  value:\n                    recipient_id: recipient-id-sandbox-9b6b4679-914b-445b-9450-efbdb80296f6\n                    request_id: 4zlKapIkTm8p5KM\n      description: |\n        Create a payment recipient for payment initiation.

Payments can be one-time or standing order (recurring) and can be denominated in either EUR or GBP.  If making domestic GBP-denominated payments, your recipient must have been created with BACS numbers. In general, EUR-denominated payments will be sent via SEPA Credit Transfer and GBP-denominated payments will be sent via the Faster Payments network, but the payment network used will be determined by the institution. Payments sent via Faster Payments will typically arrive immediately, while payments sent via SEPA Credit Transfer will typically arrive in one business day.\n\n        Standing orders (recurring payments) must be denominated in GBP and can only be sent to recipients in the UK. Once created, standing order payments cannot be modified or canceled via the API. An end user can cancel or modify a standing order directly on their banking application or website, or by contacting the bank. Standing orders will follow the payment rules of the underlying rails (Faster Payments in UK). Payments can be sent Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays. If the pre-arranged date falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the payment is made on the next working day. It is not possible to guarantee the exact time the payment will reach the recipient’s account, although at least 90% of standing order payments are sent by 6am.\n\n        In the Development environment, payments must be below 5 GBP / EUR.

Each third party has its own `auditor_id`, for example `fannie_mae`. You’ll need to create a separate Audit Copy for each third party to whom you want to grant access to the Report.\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/AssetReportAuditCopyCreateRequest'\n  /asset_report/audit_copy/remove:\n    post:\n      tags:\n      - plaid\n      summary: Remove Asset Report Audit Copy\n      externalDocs:\n        url: /api/products/assets/#asset_reportaudit_copyremove\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: OK\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/AssetReportAuditCopyRemoveResponse'\n              examples:\n                example-1:\n                  value:\n                    removed: true\n                    request_id: m8MDnv9okwxFNBV\n      operationId: assetReportAuditCopyRemove\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/AssetReportAuditCopyRemoveRequest'\n        description: \"\"\n      description: The `/asset_report/audit_copy/remove` endpoint allows you to remove an Audit Copy. Removing an Audit Copy invalidates the `audit_copy_token` associated with it, meaning both you and any third parties holding the token will no longer be able to use it to access Report data. Items associated with the Asset Report, the Asset Report itself and other Audit Copies of it are not affected and will remain accessible after removing the given Audit Copy.\n  /asset_report/relay/create:\n    post:\n      summary: Create an `asset_relay_token` to share an Asset Report with a partner client\n      tags:\n      - plaid\n      operationId: assetReportRelayCreate\n      externalDocs:\n        url: /none/\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/AssetReportRelayCreateRequest'\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: OK\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/AssetReportRelayCreateResponse'\n              examples:\n                example-1:\n                  value:\n                    asset_relay_token: assets-relay-prod-3TAU2CWVYBDVRHUCAAAI27ULU4\n                    request_id: Iam3b\n      description: |-\n        Plaid can share an Asset Report directly with a participating third party on your behalf.

To approve a transfer with null rationale code, make an authorization request with an `amount` less than the available balance in the account.\n\n          - To approve a transfer with the rationale code `MANUALLY_VERIFIED_ITEM`, create an Item in Link through the [Same Day Micro-deposits flow](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/coverage/testing/#testing-same-day-micro-deposits).\n\n          - To approve a transfer with the rationale code `LOGIN_REQUIRED`, [reset the login for an Item](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/#item_login_required).\n\n          - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `NSF`, the available balance on the account must be less than the authorization `amount`. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.\n\n          - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `RISK`, the available balance on the account must be exactly $0.

It evaluates whether a given user is supportable by digital income verification. If the user is eligible for digital verification, that information will be associated with the user token, and in this way will generate a Link UI optimized for the end user and their specific employer. If the user cannot be confirmed as eligible, the user can still use the income verification flow, but they may be required to manually upload a paystub to verify their income.\n\n        While all request fields are optional, providing `employer` data will increase the chance of receiving a useful result.\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/CreditPayrollIncomePrecheckRequest'\n  /credit/employment/get:\n    post:\n      summary: Retrieve a summary of an individual's employment information\n      tags:\n      -

You can further limit the accounts shown in Link by using `account_filters` to specify the account subtypes to be shown in Link. Only the specified subtypes will be shown. This filtering applies to both the Account Select view (if enabled) and the Institution Select view. Institutions that do not support the selected subtypes will be omitted from Link.

Note that institution status is not available in the Sandbox environment.\n      x-examples:\n        example-1:\n          status:\n            item_logins:\n              status: HEALTHY\n              last_status_change: \"2019-02-15T15:53:00Z\"\n              breakdown:\n                success: 0.9\n                error_plaid: 0.01\n                error_institution: 0.09\n            transactions_updates:\n              status: HEALTHY\n              last_status_change: \"2019-02-12T08:22:00Z\"\n              breakdown:\n                success: 0.95\n                error_plaid: 0.02\n                error_institution: 0.03\n                refresh_interval: NORMAL\n            auth:\n              status: HEALTHY\n              last_status_change: \"2019-02-15T15:53:00Z\"\n              breakdown:\n                success: 0.91\n                error_plaid: 0.01\n                error_institution: 0.08\n            identity:\n              status: DEGRADED\n              last_status_change: \"2019-02-15T15:50:00Z\"\n              breakdown:\n                success: 0.42\n                error_plaid: 0.08\n                error_institution: 0.5\n            investments:\n              status: HEALTHY\n              last_status_change: \"2019-02-15T15:53:00Z\"\n              breakdown:\n                success: 0.89\n                error_plaid: 0.02\n                error_institution: 0.09\n            liabilities:\n              status: HEALTHY\n              last_status_change: \"2019-02-15T15:53:00Z\"\n              breakdown:\n                success: 0.89\n                error_plaid: 0.02\n                error_institution: 0.09\n            investments_updates:\n              status: HEALTHY\n              last_status_change: \"2019-02-12T08:22:00Z\"\n              breakdown:\n                success: 0.95\n                error_plaid: 0.02\n                error_institution: 0.03\n                refresh_interval: NORMAL\n            liabilities_updates:\n              status: HEALTHY\n              last_status_change: \"2019-02-12T08:22:00Z\"\n              breakdown:\n                success: 0.95\n                error_plaid: 0.02\n                error_institution: 0.03\n                refresh_interval: NORMAL\n    CountryCode:\n      type: string\n      title: CountryCode\n      enum:\n      - US\n      - GB\n      - ES\n      - NL\n      - FR\n      - IE\n      - CA\n      - DE\n      - IT\n      description: ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country code standard.\n    PaymentMeta:\n      title: PaymentMeta\n      type: object\n      additionalProperties: true\n      description: |-\n        Transaction information specific to inter-bank transfers.
