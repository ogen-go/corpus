The field type becomes the attribute type, and the field path becomes the attribute name. For example, the attribute `source.ip` maps to field `AttributeContext.source.ip`.

The caller **must** not depend on the most recent policy changes. NOTE: The admission control has a hard limit of 1 referenced resources per call. If an operation refers to more than 1 resources, the caller must call the Check method multiple times. This method requires the `servicemanagement.services.check` permission on the specified service.
