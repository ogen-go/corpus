Change Correlation informs the responder why a particular change event was surfaced and correlated to an incident based on three key factors which include time, related service, or intelligence (machine learning).\n      summary: List related Change Events for an Incident\n      parameters:\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/id'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/offset_limit'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/header_Accept'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/header_Content-Type'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: The array of Change Events returned by the query.\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                type: object\n                properties:\n                  change_events:\n                    type: array\n                    items:\n                      allOf:\n                        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/ChangeEvent'\n                        - type: object\n                          properties:\n                            correlation_reason:\n                              type: object\n                              properties:\n                                reason:\n                                  type: string\n                                  enum:\n                                    - most_recent\n                                    - related_service\n                                    - intelligent\n                                  readOnly: true\n                                  description: The reason a change event was determined to be related to the given incident.\n              examples:\n                response:\n                  summary: Response Example\n                  value:\n                    change_events:\n                      - summary: Build Success - Increase snapshot create timeout to 30 seconds\n                        id: 01BBYA6PEVW6A852BUO6QYUE7O\n                        timestamp: '2020-07-17T08:42:58Z'\n                        type: change_event\n                        source: acme-build-pipeline-tool-default-i-9999\n                        integration:\n                          id: PEYSGVF\n                          type: inbound_integration_reference\n                        services:\n                          - id: PEYSGRV\n                            type: service_reference\n                        custom_details:\n                          build_state: passed\n                          build_number: '2'\n                          run_time: 1236s\n                        links:\n                          - href: https://acme.pagerduty.dev/build/2\n                            text: View more details in Acme!\n                        correlation_reason:\n                          reason: most_recent\n                      - summary: Build Success - Increase snapshot create timeout to 15 seconds\n                        id: 01BBYA6PDIXPL8KO1HPIUL9CZN\n                        timestamp: '2020-07-17T07:42:58Z'\n                        type: change_event\n                        source: acme-build-pipeline-tool-default-i-9999\n                        integration:\n                          id: PEYSGVF\n                          type: inbound_integration_reference\n                        services:\n                          - id: PEYSGRV\n                            type: service_reference\n                        custom_details:\n                          build_state: passed\n                          build_number: '1'\n                          run_time: 1233s\n                        links:\n                          - href: https://acme.pagerduty.dev/build/1\n                            text: View more details in Acme!\n                        correlation_reason:\n                          reason: related_service\n                    limit: null\n                    offset: null\n                    total: null\n                    more: false\n        '400':\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/ArgumentError'\n        '401':\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/Unauthorized'\n        '403':\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/Forbidden'\n        '404':\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/NotFound'\n  /incidents/{id}/related_incidents:\n    description: Get Related Incidents\n    get:\n      tags:\n        - Incidents\n      operationId: getRelatedIncidents\n      description: |\n        Returns the 20 most recent Related Incidents that are impacting other Responders and Services.
