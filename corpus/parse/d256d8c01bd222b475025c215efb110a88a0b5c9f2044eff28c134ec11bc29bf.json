Payment products with payment information in *JSON* format:\r\n            - ***sepa-credit-transfers***\r\n            - ***instant-sepa-credit-transfers***\r\n            - ***target-2-payments***\r\n            - ***cross-border-credit-transfers***\r\n          - Payment products with payment information in *pain.001* XML format:\r\n            - ***pain.001-sepa-credit-transfers***\r\n            - ***pain.001-instant-sepa-credit-transfers***\r\n            - ***pain.001-target-2-payments***\r\n            - ***pain.001-cross-border-credit-transfers***\r\n        \r\n        Furthermore the request body depends on the **payment-service**:\r\n          * ***payments***: A single payment initiation request.\r\n          * ***bulk-payments***: A collection of several payment initiation requests.\r\n          \r\n            In case of a *pain.001* message there are more than one payments contained in the *pain.001 message.\r\n            \r\n            In case of a *JSON* there are several JSON payment blocks contained in a joining list.\r\n          * ***periodic-payments***: \r\n            Create a standing order initiation resource for recurrent i.e. periodic payments addressable under {paymentId} \r\n             with all data relevant for the corresponding payment product and the execution of the standing order contained in a JSON body. \r\n        \r\n        This is the first step in the API to initiate the related recurring/periodic payment.\r\n          \r\n        ## Single and mulitilevel SCA Processes\r\n        \r\n        The payment initiation requests are independent from the need of one or multilevel \r\n        SCA processing, i.e. independent from the number of authorisations needed for the execution of payments. \r\n        \r\n        But the response messages are specific to either one SCA processing or multilevel SCA processing. \r\n        \r\n        For payment initiation with multilevel SCA, this specification requires an explicit start of the authorisation, \r\n        i.e. links directly associated with SCA processing like 'scaRedirect' or 'scaOAuth' cannot be contained in the \r\n        response message of a Payment Initation Request for a payment, where multiple authorisations are needed. \r\n        Also if any data is needed for the next action, like selecting an SCA method is not supported in the response, \r\n        since all starts of the multiple authorisations are fully equal. \r\n        In these cases, first an authorisation sub-resource has to be generated following the 'startAuthorisation' link.\r\n      operationId: initiatePayment\r\n      tags:\r\n        -

These accounts are addressed explicitly in the method as \r\n        parameters as a core function.\r\n        \r\n        **Side Effects**\r\n        When this consent request is a request where the \"recurringIndicator\" equals \"true\",\r\n        and if it exists already a former consent for recurring access on account information \r\n        for the addressed PSU, then the former consent automatically expires as soon as the new \r\n        consent request is authorised by the PSU.\r\n        \r\n        Optional Extension:\r\n        As an option, an ASPSP might optionally accept a specific access right on the access on all PSD2 related services for all available accounts.\r\n        \r\n        As another option an ASPSP might optionally also accept a command, where only access rights are inserted without mentioning the addressed account. \r\n        The relation to accounts is then handled afterwards between PSU and ASPSP. \r\n        This option is not supported for the Embedded SCA Approach. \r\n        As a last option, an ASPSP might in addition accept a command with access rights\r\n          * to see the list of available payment accounts or\r\n          * to

       There are several possible update PSU data requests in the context of a consent request if needed, \r\n        which depends on the SCA approach:\r\n        \r\n        * Redirect SCA Approach:\r\n          A specific Update PSU data request is applicable for \r\n            * the selection of authentication methods, before choosing the actual SCA approach.\r\n        * Decoupled SCA Approach:\r\n          A specific update PSU data request is only applicable for\r\n          * adding the PSU Identification, if not provided yet in the payment initiation request or the Account Information Consent Request, or if no OAuth2 access token is used, or\r\n          * the selection of authentication methods.\r\n        * Embedded SCA Approach: \r\n          The Update PSU data request might be used \r\n          * to add credentials as a first factor authentication data of the PSU and\r\n          * to select the authentication method and\r\n          * transaction authorisation.\r\n      \r\n        The SCA Approach might depend on the chosen SCA method. \r\n        For that reason, the following possible update PSU data request can apply to all SCA approaches:\r\n        \r\n        * Select an SCA method in case of several SCA methods are available for the customer.\r\n      \r\n        There are the following request types on this access

authorisation sub-endpoint for \r\n        the corresponding PSU authorising the signing-baskets.\r\n        \r\n        The ASPSP might make the usage of this access method unnecessary in case \r\n        of only one SCA process needed, since the related authorisation resource \r\n        might be automatically created by the ASPSP after the submission of the \r\n        payment data with the first POST signing basket call.\r\n        \r\n        The start authorisation process is a process which is needed for creating a new authorisation \r\n        or cancellation sub-resource. \r\n        \r\n        This applies in the following scenarios:\r\n        \r\n          * The ASPSP has indicated with a 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceding payment \r\n            initiation response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP. \r\n            The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be \r\n            uploaded by using the extended forms:\r\n            * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuIdentfication', \r\n            * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuAuthentication' \r\n            * 'startAuthorisationWithEncryptedPsuAuthentication'\r\n            * 'startAuthorisationWithAuthentciationMethodSelection' \r\n          * The related payment initiation cannot yet be executed since a multilevel SCA is mandated.\r\n          * The ASPSP has indicated with a 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceding \r\n            payment cancellation response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP.\r\n            The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be uploaded\r\n            by using the extended forms as indicated above.\r\n          * The related payment cancellation request cannot be applied yet since a multilevel SCA is mandate for \r\n            executing the cancellation.\r\n          * The signing basket needs to be authorised yet.\r\n      operationId: startSigningBasketAuthorisation\r\n      tags:\r\n        - Signing Baskets (SBS)\r\n        - Common Services\r\n

Redirect SCA Approach:\r\n          A specific Update PSU data request is applicable for \r\n            * the selection of authentication methods, before choosing the actual SCA approach.\r\n        * Decoupled SCA Approach:\r\n          A specific Update PSU data request is only applicable for\r\n          * adding the PSU Identification, if not provided yet in the payment initiation request or the account information consent request, or if no OAuth2 access token is used, or\r\n          * the selection of authentication methods.\r\n        * Embedded SCA Approach: \r\n          The update PSU data request might be used \r\n          * to add credentials as a first factor authentication data of the PSU and\r\n          * to select the authentication method and\r\n          * transaction authorisation.\r\n      \r\n        The SCA approach might depend on the chosen SCA method. \r\n        For that reason, the following possible update PSU data request can apply to all SCA
