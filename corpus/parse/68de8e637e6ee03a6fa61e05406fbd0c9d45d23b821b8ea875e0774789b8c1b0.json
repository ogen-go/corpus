The parts, if concatenated, must represent the same input as would be read by the current task if the split did not happen. The exact way in which the original task is decomposed into the two parts is specified either as a position demarcating them (stop_position), or explicitly as two DerivedSources, if this task consumes a user-defined source type (dynamic_source_split). The \"current\" task is adjusted as a result of the split: after a task with range [A, B) sends a stop_position update at C, its range is considered to be [A, C), e.g.: * Progress should be interpreted relative to the new range, e.g. \"75% completed\" means \"75% of [A, C) completed\" * The worker should interpret proposed_stop_position relative to the new range, e.g. \"split at 68%\" should be interpreted as \"split at 68% of [A, C)\". * If the worker chooses to split again using stop_position, only stop_positions in [A, C) will be accepted. * Etc. dynamic_source_split has similar semantics: e.g., if a task with source S splits using dynamic_source_split into {P, R} (where P and R must be together equivalent to S), then subsequent progress and proposed_stop_position should be interpreted relative to P, and in a potential subsequent dynamic_source_split into {P'', R''}, P'' and R'' must be together equivalent to P, etc.'\n        totalThrottlerWaitTimeSeconds:\n          description: Total time the worker spent being throttled by external systems.\n          format: double\n          type: number\n        workItemId:\n          description: Identifies the WorkItem.\n          type: string\n      type: object\n    WorkerDetails:\n      description: Information about a worker\n      id: WorkerDetails\n      properties:\n        workItems:\n          description: Work items processed by this worker, sorted by time.\n          items:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/WorkItemDetails'\n          type: array\n        workerName:\n          description: Name of this worker\n          type: string\n      type: object\n    WorkerHealthReport:\n      description: WorkerHealthReport contains information about the health of a worker.

To request the status of a job, we recommend using `projects.locations.jobs.getMetrics` with a [regional endpoint] (https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints). Using `projects.jobs.getMetrics` is not recommended, as you can only request the status of jobs that are running in `us-central1`.\n      operationId: dataflow.projects.jobs.getMetrics\n      parameters:\n        - description: A project id.\n          in: path\n          name: projectId\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: The job to get metrics for.\n          in: path\n          name: jobId\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: The [regional endpoint] (https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints) that contains the job specified by job_id.\n          in: query\n          name: location\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: Return only metric data that has changed since this time.
