'\n  name: Data Plane control API\n- description: \"The public API of the Data Plane is a data proxy enabling a data consumer\\\n    \\ to actively querydata from the provider data source (e.g. backend Rest API,\\\n    \\ internal database...) through its Data Planeinstance. Thus the Data Plane is\\\n    \\ the only entry/output door for the data, which avoids the provider to exposedirectly\\\n    \\ its data externally.The Data Plane public API being a proxy, it supports all\\\n    \\ verbs (i.e. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), whichcan then conveyed until the\\\n    \\ data source is required. This is especially useful when the actual data sourceis\\\n    \\ a Rest API itself.In the same manner, any set of arbitrary query parameters,\\\n    \\ path parameters and request body are supported (in the limits fixed by the HTTP\\\n    \\ server) and can also conveyed to the actual data source.\"\n  name: Data Plane public API\npaths:\n  /transfer:\n    post:\n      description: Initiates a data transfer for the given request.
