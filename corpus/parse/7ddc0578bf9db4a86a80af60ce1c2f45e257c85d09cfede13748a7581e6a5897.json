Sumo Logic has several deployments that are assigned depending on the geographic location and the date an account is created. For details determining your account's deployment see [API endpoints](https://help.sumologic.com/?cid=3011).\n      The [Content Import API](#operation/beginAsyncImport) can be used to create or update a Search, Scheduled Search, or Dashboard. Here is an example creating a Scheduled Search:\n      1. Get the identifier of your `Personal` folder.\n        ```bash\n        curl -X GET -u \"\u003caccessId\u003e:\u003caccessKey\u003e\" https://api.sumologic.com/api/v2/content/folders/personal\n        ```\n\n        Find the identifier of your `Personal` folder in the response.\n        ```json\n        {\n            ...\n            \"id\": \"0000000006A2E86F\", \u003c----\n            \"name\": \"Personal\",\n            \"itemType\": \"Folder\",\n            ...\n        }\n        ```\n\n        You can use [getFolder](#operation/getFolder), [getAdminRecommededFolder](#operation/getAdminRecommendedFolderAsync),\n        or [getGlobalFolder](#operation/getGlobalFolderAsync) endpoints to traverse the content tree and find the identifier of any\n        folder you want to manage.\n\n      2. Use the [Content Import API](#operation/beginAsyncImport) to create a new Scheduled Search inside your\n        `Personal` folder.\n        ```bash\n        curl -X POST -u \"\u003caccessId\u003e:\u003caccessKey\u003e\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d @search.json https://api.sumologic.com/api/v2/content/folders/0000000006A2E86F/import\n        ```\n\n        The data file `search.json` in the above command has the following `SavedSearchWithScheduleSyncDefinition` object.\n        ```json\n        // file: search.json\n        {\n            \"type\": \"SavedSearchWithScheduleSyncDefinition\",\n            \"name\": \"demo-scheduled-search\",\n            \"description\": \"Runs every hour with timerange of 15m and sends email notifications\",\n            \"search\": {\n                \"queryText\": \"\\\"error\\\" and \\\"warn\\\"\",\n                \"defaultTimeRange\": \"-15m\",\n                \"byReceiptTime\": false,\n                \"viewName\": \"\",\n                \"viewStartTime\": null,\n                \"queryParameters\": []\n            },\n            \"searchSchedule\": {\n                \"cronExpression\": \"0 0/15 * * * ? *\",\n                \"displayableTimeRange\": \"-15m\",\n                \"parseableTimeRange\": {\n                    \"from\": {\n                        \"relativeTime\": \"-15m\",\n                        \"type\": \"RelativeTimeRangeBoundary\"\n                    },\n                    \"to\": null,\n                    \"type\": \"BeginBoundedTimeRange\"\n                },\n                \"timeZone\": \"America/Los_Angeles\",\n                \"threshold\": null,\n                \"notification\": {\n                    \"taskType\": \"EmailSearchNotificationSyncDefinition\",\n                    \"toList\": [\n                        \"ops@acme.org\"\n                    ],\n                    \"subjectTemplate\": \"Search Results: {{SearchName}}\",\n                    \"includeQuery\": true,\n                    \"includeResultSet\": true,\n                    \"includeHistogram\": true,\n                    \"includeCsvAttachment\": false\n                },\n                \"muteErrorEmails\": false,\n                \"scheduleType\": \"1Hour\",\n                \"parameters\": []\n            }\n        }\n        ```\n\n        The response of above request will have the job identifier that you can use to track the status of the import job.\n        ```json\n        {\n            \"id\": \"74DC17FA765C7443\"\n        }\n        ```\n\n      3. Use the job identifier from the import request to get the [status](#operation/getAsyncImportStatus) of the\n        import job.\n        ```bash\n        curl -X GET -u \"\u003caccessId\u003e:\u003caccessKey\u003e\" https://api.sumologic.com/api/v2/content/folders/0000000006A2E86F/import/74DC17FA765C7443/status\n        ```\n\n        If you are importing a large item, you might have to wait for the import job to finish. The following is an\n        example response from a completed job.\n        ```json\n        {\n            \"status\": \"Success\",\n            \"statusMessage\": null,\n            \"error\": null\n        }\n        ```\n    x-displayName: Content\n  - name: contentPermissions\n    description: |\n      Content permissions API.\n\n      You can share your folders, searches, and dashboards with specific users or roles.
