Detective automatically extracts time-based events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic from AWS CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It also extracts findings detected by Amazon GuardDuty.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set of member accounts, and is created and managed by an administrator account.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEvery behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to manage graphs that belong to the Region that is associated with the currently selected endpoint.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA Detective administrator account can use the Detective API to do the following:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003e \u003cp\u003eEnable and disable Detective.
