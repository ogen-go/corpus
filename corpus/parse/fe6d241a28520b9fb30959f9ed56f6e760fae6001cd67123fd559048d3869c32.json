Some requests have replies\n        to give you some information about how they are applied. Other requests do\n        not need to return information; these each return an empty reply. The order\n        of replies matches that of the requests. For example, suppose you call batchUpdate\n        with four updates, and only the third one returns information. The response\n        would have two empty replies: the reply to the third request, and another\n        empty reply, in that order. Because other users may be editing the presentation,\n        the presentation might not exactly reflect your changes: your changes may\n        be altered with respect to collaborator changes. If there are no collaborators,\n        the presentation should reflect your changes. In any case, the updates in\n        your request are guaranteed to be applied together atomically.'\n      operationId: slides.presentations.batchUpdate\n      parameters:\n      - description: The presentation to apply the updates to.\n        in: path\n        name: presentationId\n        required: true\n        schema:\n          type: string\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/BatchUpdatePresentationRequest'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/BatchUpdatePresentationResponse'\n          description: Successful response\n      security:\n      - Oauth2:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive\n        Oauth2c:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive\n      - Oauth2:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file\n        Oauth2c:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file\n      - Oauth2:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly\n        Oauth2c:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly\n      - Oauth2:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations\n        Oauth2c:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations\n      - Oauth2:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets\n        Oauth2c:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets\n      - Oauth2:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly\n        Oauth2c:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly\n      tags:\n      - presentations\n  /v1/presentations/{presentationsId}:\n    get:\n      description: Gets the latest version of the specified presentation.\n      operationId: slides.presentations.get\n      parameters:\n      - in: path\n        name: presentationsId\n        required: true\n        schema:\n          type: string\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Presentation'\n          description: Successful response\n      security:\n      - Oauth2:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive\n        Oauth2c:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive\n      - Oauth2:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file\n        Oauth2c:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file\n      - Oauth2:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly\n        Oauth2c:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly\n      - Oauth2:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations\n        Oauth2c:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations\n      - Oauth2:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations.readonly\n        Oauth2c:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations.readonly\n      tags:\n      - presentations\n    parameters:\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/_.xgafv'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/access_token'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/alt'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/callback'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/fields'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/key'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/oauth_token'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/prettyPrint'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/quotaUser'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/upload_protocol'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/uploadType'\nservers:\n- url: https://slides.googleapis.com/\ntags:\n- name: presentations\n"
