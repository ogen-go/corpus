description: |-\n        Creates a card.\n\n        Create the user and card product before you create the card.\n        You create a card using the `user_token` of the user who will own the card and the `card_product_token` of the card product that will control the card.\n\n        [TIP]\n        By default, newly created cards are inactive and must be explicitly activated (see \u003c\u003c/core-api/cards#_create_card_transition, Create Card Transition\u003e\u003e for information on activating cards).\n        To create cards that are activated upon issue, configure your card product's `config.card_life_cycle.activate_upon_issue` field (see \u003c\u003c/core-api/card-products, Card Products\u003e\u003e).\n\n        Send a `POST` request to `/pins/controltoken` to set the card's PIN if your program requires PIN numbers (for example, for EMV cards); this action updates the `pin_is_set` field to `true`.\n        See \u003c\u003c/core-api/pins#_create_or_update_pin, Create or Update PIN\u003e\u003e for details.\n\n        You can use optional query parameters to show the PAN and CVV2 number in the response.\n        If `show_pan` and `show_cvv_number` are set to `true`, the fulfillment state of the card is `DIGITALLY_PRESENTED` instead of the typical initial state of `ISSUED`.\n        This fulfillment state does not affect the delivery of physical cards.\n\n        This endpoint requires PCI DSS compliance if `show_pan` and `show_cvv_number` are set to `true`.\n        You must comply with PCI DSS data security requirements if you store, transmit, or

on this page.\n\n        To perform KYC verification on users, the `user` object must have the following fields configured:\n\n        * `first_name`\n        * `last_name`\n        * `address1` (cannot be a PO Box)\n        * `city`\n        * `state`\n        * `postal_code`\n        * `country`\n        * `birth_date`\n        * `identifications`\n\n        [NOTE]\n        The `identifications` requirement depends on your program's configuration.\n        To determine if you should provide a full or abbreviated identification number, contact your Marqeta representative.\n        KYC verification requires the full Social Security Number (SSN) of the user.\n\n        To create a child user, you must identify the parent user or business and decide whether the child user shares an account with the parent.\n\n        The parent must be an existing user or business.\n        On the child user, set the `parent_token` field to the value of the parent's `token` field.\n        If either the parent or the parent's parent is a business, a `business_token` field is added to the user.\n        This field's value is set to the token of either the parent or grandparent (whichever is the business).\n\n        The `uses_parent_account` field determines whether the child shares balances with the parent (`true`) or whether the child balances are independent of the parent (`false`).\n        If you do not specify a value for `uses_parent_account`, it is set to `false` by default (the user does not share the parent's balance) and returned in the response body.\n        This field cannot be updated, so you must decide upon creation whether the child user shares the parent balance.\n\n        Sharing an account with a parent user affects how the child user interacts with cards as follows:\n\n        * A child user cannot spend funds if its parent is not active.\n        * An active child user can activate cards, whether the parent is active or not.\n

*Case #3* – Application token, user's Marqeta password, and user's email address\n\n        In each case, provide the application token as the HTTP Basic Authentication username in the request header's Authorization field.\n        When applicable, provide the user access token or admin access token as the HTTP Basic Authentication password.\n        When applicable, provide the user token

operation without having to log out the user (case #3).\n\n        [NOTE]\n        Calling this endpoint and returning a single-use access token does not invalidate the user's current user access

endpoint to validate credentials and connectivity.\n        Your webhook endpoint must be configured to respond.\n\n        *Configuring your webhook endpoint*\n\n        This subsection describes the ping request that your webhook endpoint should expect and its expected response.\n\n        When the Marqeta platform receives the ping request, it sends a `POST` request containing the following body to the URL of your webhook endpoint:\n\n        [#ping-webhook-sample]\n        [source,json]\n        ----\n        {\n          \"pings\": [\n            {\n              \"token\": \"marqeta\",\n              \"payload\": \"healthcheck\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n        ----\n\n        To indicate that it is functioning properly, your webhook endpoint must respond with a status code of \"200\" (see \u003c\u003c/developer-guides/signature-verification, Signature Verification\u003e\u003e for a code example that identifies a ping request).\n        The response can optionally include a link:http://www.json.org/[JSON, window=\"_blank\"]-formatted body, for example:\n\n        [#ping-webhook-sample-2]\n        [source,json]\n        ----\n        {\"my_endpoint_status\": \"alive\"}\n        ----\n\n        The Marqeta platform then responds to its requestor by echoing, as-is, the response code and body received from your webhook endpoint.\n\n        *Using the ping facility*\n\n        To ping a webhook endpoint, send a `POST` request to `/webhooks/{token}/ping` and use the `token` path parameter to specify the webhook to ping.\n        Include an empty, JSON-formatted body in the request, that is:\n\n        [#ping-webhook-sample-3]\n        [source,json]\n        ----\n        {}\n        ----\n\n        The following chain of actions occurs during a successful ping:\n\n        . The Marqeta platform receives the ping request (`POST` to `/webhooks/{token}/ping`).\n        . The Marqeta platform sends a request to your webhook endpoint.\n        . Your webhook endpoint responds with a status code of \"200\" and an optional body.\n        . The Marqeta platform responds to its requestor by echoing, as-is, the response code and body received from your webhook endpoint.\n\n        [NOTE]\n        If the customer-hosted endpoint fails to respond within five seconds, the Marqeta platform times out the request and responds with the following message body (where `\u003coptional message\u003e` represents additional details you can choose to include in the response):\n\n        [#ping-webhook-sample-4]\n        [source,json]\n        ----\n        {\n          \"error_message\": \"Webhook operation failed \" + \u003coptional message\u003e,\n          \"error_code\": \"422600\"\n        }\n        ----\n\n        Failed pings are not automatically retried.\n      operationId: postWebhooksTokenPing\n      parameters:\n
