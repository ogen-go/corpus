It\n      also provides an easy access to\n\n      its size, mime-type, user-defined tags and description thus allowing easy\n      sorting and searching among stored\n\n      files.\n\n      There are several methods of file uploading available: multipart/form-data\n      encoded form, RAW POST (by sending\n\n      file contents as POST body), fetching from URL (by providing the file URL\n      via 'url' param)\n\n      Attachment is an entity that is used to link a File to one or multiple\n      objects like Customer, Dispute, Payment,\n\n      Transaction, Order, Plan, Product, Invoice, Note. That allows to\n      quickly find and use files related to\n\n      those specific entities.\n  - name: Invoices\n    description: \u003e\n      Invoices leave a record for both you and your customer of the products\n      sold.\n  - name: Payment Instruments\n    description: \u003e\n      The Payment Instrument allows you to accept a variety of payment methods through a single API.\n  - name: Payment Tokens\n    description: \u003e\n      Payment tokens are used to reduce the scope of PCI DSS compliance.  A\n      payment\n\n      token can be made using a different authentication scheme (refer to the\n      public key\n\n      authentication scheme in the Authentication section), which allows you to\n\n      create a payment token directly from the browser, bypassing the need to\n      send\n\n      sensitive cardholder info to your servers.  We recommend using this with\n      our\n\n      Rebilly.js library, which helps you wire a form into this API resource and\n      create\n\n      payment tokens.\n  - name: Plans\n    description: \u003e\n      Plans are a template for making a subscription.  For example, you may have\n      a plan\n\n      that has a 30-day free trial followed by a recurring charge of $19.95 per\n      month\n\n      until canceled.  The combination of the plan and a request to make an\n      order\n\n      will apply those instructions to create the invoices according to the\n      plan's\n\n      schedule.\n  - name: Products\n    description: |\n      A product describes what you sell (goods or services).\n      A product determines how what you sell appears on invoices and receipts.\n      The pricing for products is set in Plans.

You may see\n\n      the [User API Documentation\n      here](https://user-api-docs.rebilly.com).\n\n      A User represents a person who can login to Rebilly, and take actions\n      subject to\n\n      their granted permissions.  It has resources less commonly integrated by\n\n      3rd parties.\n  - name: Fees\n    description: |\n      Buy and sell fees.\n\n      This API is experimental and not guaranteed to be backward
