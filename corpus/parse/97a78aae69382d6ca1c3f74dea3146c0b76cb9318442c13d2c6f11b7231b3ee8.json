When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event`\n        object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded`\n        event; and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an\n        `invoice.payment_failed` event. Note that many API requests may cause multiple\n        events to be created. For example, if you create a new subscription for a\n        customer, you will receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a\n        `charge.succeeded` event.\n\n        Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The state of that\n        resource at the time of the change is embedded in the event's data field. For\n        example, a `charge.succeeded` event will contain a charge, and an\n        `invoice.payment_failed` event will contain an invoice.\n\n        As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an\n        [individual event](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](https://stripe.com/docs/api#list_events)\n        from the API. We also have a separate\n        [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the\n        `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. Webhooks are managed\n        in your\n        [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks'),\n        and our [Using Webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) guide will help you get set up.\n\n        When using [Connect](https://stripe.com/docs/connect), you can also receive notifications of\n        events that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there will be an\n        additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.\n\n        **NOTE:** Right now, access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) is\n        guaranteed only for 30 days.\n      properties:\n        account:\n          description: The connected account that originated the event.\n          maxLength: 5000\n          type: string\n        api_version:\n          description: 'The Stripe API version used to render `data`. *Note: This\n            property is populated only for events on or after October 31, 2014*.'\n          maxLength: 5000\n          nullable: true\n          type: string\n        created:\n          description: Time at which the object was created.

Note\n        that finalizing the invoice,\n        [when automatic](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/workflow/#auto_advance), does\n        not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits\n        until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last\n        webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have\n        connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after\n        creation to finalize the invoice.\n\n        If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your\n        [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic'),\n        Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These\n        emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\n        Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the\n        amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually\n        charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's [minimum allowed charge\n        per currency](/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the\n        invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the\n        customer's running account balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\n        More details on the customer's account balance are\n        [here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/object#customer_object-account_balance).\n\n        Related guide: [Send Invoices to Customers](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/sending).\n      properties:\n        account_country:\n          description: The country of the business associated with this invoice, most\n            often the business creating the invoice.\n          maxLength: 5000\n          nullable: true\n          type: string\n        account_name:\n          description: The public name of the business associated with this invoice,\n            most often the business creating the invoice.\n          maxLength: 5000\n          nullable: true\n          type: string\n        amount_due:\n          description: Final amount due at this time for this invoice.

A token representing this information is\n        returned to your server to use. You should use our\n        [recommended payments integrations](https://stripe.com/docs/payments) to perform this process\n        client-side. This ensures that no sensitive card data touches your server,\n        and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\n        If you cannot use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using\n        the API with either your publishable or secret API key. Keep in mind that if\n        your integration uses this method, you are responsible for any PCI compliance\n        that may be required, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with\n        client-side tokenization, your customer's information is not sent directly to\n        Stripe, so we cannot determine how it is handled or stored.\n\n        Tokens cannot be stored or used more than once. To store card or bank account\n        information for later use, you can create [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#customers)\n        objects or [Custom accounts](https://stripe.com/docs/api#external_accounts). Note that\n        [Radar](https://stripe.com/docs/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection,\n        supports only integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\n        Related guide: [Accept a payment](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment-charges#web-create-token)\n      properties:\n        bank_account:\n          \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/bank_account\"\n        card:\n          \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/card\"\n        client_ip:\n          description: IP address of the client that generated the token.\n          maxLength: 5000\n          nullable: true\n          type: string\n        created:\n          description: Time at which the object was created.
