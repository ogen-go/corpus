All collection resources are \\npluralized to indicate to the client they are interacting with a collection of multiple resources of the same type.\\nSingular resource names are used when there exists only one resource available to interact with.\\n\\nThe following naming conventions are used by this API:\\n\\n| Type                                          | Case                     |\\n| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |\\n| Resource names                                | `strike-through-case`    |\\n| Header, body, and query parameters parameters | `camelCase`              |\\n| JSON fields and property names                | `snake_case`             |\\n\\n### Collections\\n\\nA collection resource is a parent resource for instance resources, but can itself be retrieved and operated on \\nindependently. Collection resources use a pluralized resource name. The resource path for collection resources follow \\nthe convention:\\n\\n```\\n/{resource_name}\\n```\\n\\nCollection resources can support the `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` operations.\\n\\n#### GET\\n\\nThe `GET` operation invoked on a collection resource indicates a request to retrieve all, or some, of the entities \\ncontained within the collection. This also includes the optional capability to filter or search resources during\\nthe request. The response from a collection listing is a paginated document.\\n\\n#### POST\\n\\nThe `POST` is a non-idempotent operation that allows for the creation of a new resource when the resource identifier \\nis not provided by the system during the creation operation (i.e. the Security Console generates the identifier). The\\ncontent of the `POST` request is sent in the request body. The response to a successful `POST` request should be a \\n`201 CREATED` with a valid `Location` header field set to the URI that can be used to access to the newly \\ncreated resource. \\n\\nThe `POST` to a collection resource can also be used to interact with asynchronous resources. In this situation, \\ninstead of a `201 CREATED` response, the `202 ACCEPTED` response indicates that processing of the request is not fully \\ncomplete but has been accepted for future processing. This request will respond similarly with a `Location` header with \\nlink to the job-oriented asynchronous resource that was created and/or queued.\\n\\n#### PUT\\n\\nThe `PUT` is an idempotent operation that either performs a create with user-supplied identity, or a full replace\\nor update of a resource by a known identifier. The response to a `PUT` operation to create an entity is a `201 Created`\\nwith a valid `Location` header field set to the URI that can be used to access to the newly created resource.\\n\\n`PUT` on a collection resource replaces all values in the collection. The typical response to a `PUT` operation that \\nupdates an entity is hypermedia links, which may link to related resources caused by the side-effects of the changes \\nperformed.\\n\\n#### DELETE\\n\\nThe `DELETE` is an idempotent operation that physically deletes a resource, or removes an association between resources.\\nThe typical response to a `DELETE` operation is hypermedia links, which may link to related resources caused by the \\nside-effects of the changes performed.\\n\\n### Instances\\n\\nAn instance resource is a \\\"leaf\\\" level resource that may be retrieved, optionally nested within a collection resource.\\nInstance resources are usually retrievable with opaque identifiers. The resource path for instance resources follows \\nthe convention:\\n\\n```\\n/{resource_name}/{instance_id}...\\n```\\n\\nInstance resources can support the `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` operations.\\n\\n#### GET\\n\\nRetrieves the details of a specific resource by its identifier. The details retrieved can be controlled through \\nproperty selection and property views. The content of the resource is returned within the body of the response in the \\nacceptable media type. \\n\\n#### PUT\\n\\nAllows for and idempotent \\\"full update\\\" (complete replacement) on a specific resource. If the resource does not exist, \\nit will be created; if it does exist, it is completely overwritten. Any omitted properties in the request are assumed to \\nbe undefined/null. For \\\"partial updates\\\" use `POST` or `PATCH` instead. \\n\\nThe content of the `PUT` request is sent in the request body. The identifier of the resource is specified within the URL \\n(not the request body). The response to a successful `PUT` request is a `201 CREATED` to represent the created status, \\nwith a valid `Location` header field set to the URI that can be used to access to the newly created (or fully replaced) \\nresource. \\n\\n#### POST\\n\\nPerforms a non-idempotent creation of a new resource. The `POST` of an instance resource most commonly occurs with the \\nuse of nested resources (e.g. searching on a parent collection resource). The response to a `POST` of an instance \\nresource is typically a `200 OK` if the resource is non-persistent, and a `201 CREATED` if there is a resource \\ncreated/persisted as a result of the operation. This varies by endpoint.\\n\\n#### PATCH\\n\\nThe `PATCH` operation is used to perform a partial update of a resource. `PATCH` is a non-idempotent operation that\\nenforces an atomic mutation of a resource. Only the properties specified in the request are to be overwritten on the \\nresource it is applied to. If a property is missing, it is assumed to not have changed.\\n\\n#### DELETE\\n\\nPermanently removes the individual resource from the system. If the resource is an association between resources, only \\nthe association is removed, not the resources themselves. A successful deletion of the resource should return \\n`204 NO CONTENT` with no response body. This operation is not fully idempotent, as follow-up requests to delete a \\nnon-existent resource should return a `404 NOT FOUND`.\\n\\n## Formats\\n\\n### Dates \u0026 Times\\n\\nDates and/or times are specified as strings in the ISO 8601 format(s). The following formats are supported as input:\\n\\n| Value                       | Format                                                 | Notes                                                 |\\n| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |\\n| Date                        | YYYY-MM-DD                                             | Defaults to 12 am UTC (if used for a date \u0026 time      |\\n| Date \u0026 time only            | YYYY-MM-DD'T'hh:mm:ss[.nnn]                            | Defaults to UTC                                       |\\n| Date \u0026 time in UTC          | YYYY-MM-DD'T'hh:mm:ss[.nnn]Z                           |                                                       |\\n| Date \u0026 time w/ offset       | YYYY-MM-DD'T'hh:mm:ss[.nnn][+\u0026#124;-]hh:mm             |                                                       |\\n| Date \u0026 time w/ zone-offset  | YYYY-MM-DD'T'hh:mm:ss[.nnn][+\u0026#124;-]hh:mm[\u003czone-id\u003e]  |                                                       |\\n \\n### Timezones\\n\\nTimezones are specified in the regional zone format, such as `\\\"America/Los_Angeles\\\"`, `\\\"Asia/Tokyo\\\"`, or `\\\"GMT\\\"`.\\n \\n### Paging\\n\\nPagination may be supported on collection resources using a combination of two query parameters, `page` and `size`. \\nThe page parameter dictates the  zero-based index of the page to retrieve, and the `size` indicates the size of the page. \\n\\nFor example, `/resources?page=2\u0026size=10` will return page 3, with 10 records per page, giving results 21-30.\\n\\nThe maximum page size for a request is 1000.\\n\\nSome paginated endpoints may supported \\\"cursored\\\" pages, allowing for a guaranteed consistent view of data across page\\nboundaries. Cursored page requests support a consistent, sequential way to access data across pages. Only if this option \\nis used are you guaranteed that you will read a record once and only once in any page (\\\"repeatable read\\\"). \\nIf not supported, or not specified, the results may shift across page boundaries while they are being read as data updates \\n(\\\"read committed\\\"). The `cursor` property is used to follow the same chain of paginated requests from page to page. Each \\nrequest will change the value of the next cursor to use on the subsequent page, and may only be used to iterate sequentially\\nthrough pages.\\n\\nThe response to a paginated request follows the format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n   data\\\": [ \\n      ... \\n   ],\\n   \\\"metadata\\\": { \\n      \\\"index\\\": ...,\\n      \\\"size\\\": ...,\\n      \\\"sort\\\": ...,\\n      \\\"total_data\\\": ...,\\n      \\\"total_pages\\\": ...,\\n      \\\"cursor\\\": ...\\n   },\\n   \\\"links\\\": [ \\n      \\\"first\\\" : {\\n         \\\"href\\\" : \\\"...\\\"\\n       },\\n       \\\"prev\\\" : {\\n         \\\"href\\\" : \\\"...\\\"\\n       },\\n       \\\"self\\\" : {\\n         \\\"href\\\" : \\\"...\\\"\\n       },\\n       \\\"next\\\" : {\\n         \\\"href\\\" : \\\"...\\\"\\n       },\\n       \\\"last\\\" : {\\n         \\\"href\\\" : \\\"...\\\"\\n       } \\n   ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe `data` property is an array of the resources being retrieved from the endpoint, each which should contain at \\nminimum a \\\"self\\\" relation hypermedia link. The `metadata` property outlines the details of the current page and total\\npossible pages. The object for the page includes the following properties:\\n\\n- `index` - The page number (zero-based) of the page returned.\\n- `size` - The size of the pages, which is less than or equal to the maximum page size.\\n- `total_data` - The total amount of resources available across all pages.\\n- `total_pages` - The total amount of pages.\\n- `cursor` - An optional cursor for \\\"cursored\\\" page requests\\n\\nThe last property of the paged response is the `links` array, which contains all available hypermedia links. For \\npaginated responses, the \\\"self\\\", \\\"next\\\", \\\"previous\\\", \\\"first\\\", and \\\"last\\\" links are returned. The \\\"self\\\" link must\\nalways be returned and should contain a link to allow the client to replicate the original request against the \\ncollection resource in an identical manner to that in which it was invoked. \\n\\nThe \\\"next\\\" and \\\"previous\\\" links are present if either or both there exists a previous or next page, respectively. \\nThe \\\"next\\\" and \\\"previous\\\" links have hrefs that allow \\\"natural movement\\\" to the next page, that is all parameters \\nrequired to move the next page are provided in the link. The \\\"first\\\" and \\\"last\\\" links provide references to the first\\nand last pages respectively. If the page is \\\"cursored\\\" the cursor is automatically incorporated into the pagination links.\\n\\n### Sorting\\n\\nSorting is supported on paginated resources with the `sort` query parameter(s). The sort query parameter(s) supports \\nidentifying a single or multi-property sort with a single or multi-direction output. The format of the parameter is:\\n\\n```\\nsort=property[,ASC|DESC]...\\n```\\n\\nTherefore, the request `/resources?sort=name,title,DESC` would return the results sorted by the name and title \\ndescending, in that order. The sort directions are either ascending `ASC` or descending `DESC`. With single-order \\nsorting, all properties are sorted in the same direction. To sort the results with varying orders by property,\\n multiple sort parameters are passed. \\n \\nFor example, the request `/resources?sort=name,ASC\u0026sort=title,DESC` would sort by name ascending and title \\ndescending, in that order.\\n\\n## Responses\\n\\nThe following response statuses may be returned by this API.\\n   \\n| Status | Meaning                  | Usage                                                                                                                                                                    |\\n| ------ | ------------------------ |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| `200`  | OK                       | The operation performed without error according to the specification of the request, and no more specific 2xx code is suitable.                                          |\\n| `201`  | Created                  | A create request has been fulfilled and a resource has been created.

All 4xx and 5xx responses will return an error response in the body. The format of the \\nresponse is as follows:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n   \\\"status\\\": \u003cstatusCode\u003e,\\n   \\\"message\\\": \u003cmessage\u003e,\\n   \\\"localized_message\\\": \u003cmessage\u003e,\\n   \\\"links\\\" : [ {\\n      \\\"rel\\\" : \\\"...\\\",\\n      \\\"href\\\" : \\\"...\\\"\\n    } ]\\n} \\n ```\\n \\nThe `status` property is the same as the HTTP status returned in the response, to ease client parsing. The message \\nproperty is a localized message in the request client's locale (if applicable) that articulates the nature of the \\nerror.

As necessary, \\nerror statuses and messages may be obscured to strengthen security and prevent information exposure.
