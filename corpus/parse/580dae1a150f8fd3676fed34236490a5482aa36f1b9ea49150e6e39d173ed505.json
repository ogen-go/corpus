The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers,\n            depending on whether the coordinate reference system includes a\n            vertical axis (elevation or depth):\n\n            * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1\n            * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2\n            * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 3 (optional)\n            * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1\n            * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2\n            * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 3 (optional)\n\n            The coordinate reference system of the values is WGS84\n            longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84) unless\n            a different coordinate reference system is specified in the parameter\n            `bbox-crs`.\n\n            For WGS84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence\n            of minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum\n            latitude. However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the\n            first value (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value\n            (east-most box edge).\n\n            If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the\n            decision of the server whether only a single spatial geometry property\n            is used to determine the extent or all relevant geometries.\n\n            Example: The bounding box of the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone in\n            WGS 84 (from 160.6°E to 170°W and from 55.95°S to 25.89°S) would be\n            represented in JSON as `[160.6, -55.95, -170, -25.89]` and in a query as\n            `bbox=160.6,-55.95,-170,-25.89`.\n          type: array\n          minItems: 4\n          maxItems: 6\n          items:\n            type: number\n          example:\n          - -110\n          - 39.5\n          - -105\n          - 40.5\n    collectionsArray:\n      type: array\n      description: |-\n        Array of Collection IDs to include in the search for items.\n        Only Items in one of the provided Collections will be searched.\n      items:\n        type: string\n    ids:\n      type: array\n      description: |-\n        Array of Item ids to return.
