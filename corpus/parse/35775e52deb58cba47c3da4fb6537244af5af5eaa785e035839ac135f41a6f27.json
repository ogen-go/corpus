Batch computing is a common way for developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources, and AWS Batch removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing the required infrastructure. AWS Batch will be familiar to users of traditional batch computing software. This service can efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted in order to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver results quickly. As a fully managed service, AWS Batch enables developers, scientists, and engineers to run batch computing workloads of any scale. AWS Batch automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes the workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of the workloads. With AWS Batch, there is no need to install or manage batch computing software, which allows you to focus on analyzing results and solving problems. AWS Batch reduces operational complexities, saves time, and reduces costs, which makes it easy for developers, scientists, and engineers to run their batch jobs in the AWS Cloud.\",\n    \"x-logo\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chainjet/assets/master/integrations/aws/Arch_AWS-Batch_64.svg\"\n    },\n    \"termsOfService\": \"https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/\",\n    \"contact\": {\n      \"name\": \"Mike Ralphson\",\n      \"email\": \"mike.ralphson@gmail.com\",\n      \"url\": \"https://github.com/mermade/aws2openapi\",\n      \"x-twitter\": \"PermittedSoc\"\n    },\n    \"license\": {\n      \"name\": \"Apache 2.0 License\",\n      \"url\": \"http://www.apache.org/licenses/\"\n    },\n    \"x-providerName\": \"amazonaws.com\",\n    \"x-serviceName\": \"batch\",\n    \"x-origin\": [\n      {\n        \"contentType\": \"application/json\",\n        \"url\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/batch-2016-08-10.normal.json\",\n        \"converter\": {\n          \"url\": \"https://github.com/mermade/aws2openapi\",\n          \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n        },\n        \"x-apisguru-driver\": \"external\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"x-apiClientRegistration\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html?nc2=h_ct\"\n    },\n    \"x-apisguru-categories\": [\"cloud\"],\n    \"x-preferred\": true\n  },\n  \"externalDocs\": {\n    \"description\": \"Amazon Web Services documentation\",\n    \"url\": \"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/\"\n  },\n  \"servers\": [\n    {\n      \"url\": \"http://batch.{region}.amazonaws.com\",\n      \"variables\": {\n        \"region\": {\n          \"description\": \"The AWS region\",\n          \"enum\": [\n            \"us-east-1\",\n            \"us-east-2\",\n            \"us-west-1\",\n            \"us-west-2\",\n            \"us-gov-west-1\",\n            \"us-gov-east-1\",\n            \"ca-central-1\",\n            \"eu-north-1\",\n            \"eu-west-1\",\n            \"eu-west-2\",\n            \"eu-west-3\",\n            \"eu-central-1\",\n            \"eu-south-1\",\n            \"af-south-1\",\n            \"ap-northeast-1\",\n            \"ap-northeast-2\",\n            \"ap-northeast-3\",\n            \"ap-southeast-1\",\n            \"ap-southeast-2\",\n            \"ap-east-1\",\n            \"ap-south-1\",\n            \"sa-east-1\",\n            \"me-south-1\"\n          ],\n          \"default\": \"us-east-1\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"description\": \"The AWS Batch multi-region endpoint\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://batch.{region}.amazonaws.com\",\n      \"variables\": {\n        \"region\": {\n          \"description\": \"The AWS region\",\n          \"enum\": [\n            \"us-east-1\",\n            \"us-east-2\",\n            \"us-west-1\",\n            \"us-west-2\",\n            \"us-gov-west-1\",\n            \"us-gov-east-1\",\n            \"ca-central-1\",\n            \"eu-north-1\",\n            \"eu-west-1\",\n            \"eu-west-2\",\n            \"eu-west-3\",\n            \"eu-central-1\",\n            \"eu-south-1\",\n            \"af-south-1\",\n            \"ap-northeast-1\",\n            \"ap-northeast-2\",\n            \"ap-northeast-3\",\n            \"ap-southeast-1\",\n            \"ap-southeast-2\",\n            \"ap-east-1\",\n            \"ap-south-1\",\n            \"sa-east-1\",\n            \"me-south-1\"\n          ],\n          \"default\": \"us-east-1\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"description\": \"The AWS Batch multi-region endpoint\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"http://batch.{region}.amazonaws.com.cn\",\n      \"variables\": {\n        \"region\": {\n          \"description\": \"The AWS region\",\n          \"enum\": [\"cn-north-1\", \"cn-northwest-1\"],\n          \"default\": \"cn-north-1\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"description\": \"The AWS Batch endpoint for China (Beijing) and China (Ningxia)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://batch.{region}.amazonaws.com.cn\",\n      \"variables\": {\n        \"region\": {\n          \"description\": \"The AWS region\",\n          \"enum\": [\"cn-north-1\", \"cn-northwest-1\"],\n          \"default\": \"cn-north-1\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"description\": \"The AWS Batch endpoint for China (Beijing) and China (Ningxia)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"paths\": {\n    \"/v1/canceljob\": {\n      \"post\": {\n        \"operationId\": \"CancelJob\",\n        \"description\": \"Cancels a job in an AWS Batch job queue.

When you create a job queue, you associate one or more compute environments to the queue and assign an order of preference for the compute environments.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou also set a priority to the job queue that determines the order in which the AWS Batch scheduler places jobs onto its associated compute environments. For example, if a compute environment is associated with more than one job queue, the job queue with a higher priority is given preference for scheduling jobs to that compute environment.\u003c/p\u003e\",\n        \"responses\": {\n          \"200\": {\n            \"description\": \"Success\",\n            \"content\": {\n              \"application/json\": {\n                \"schema\": {\n                  \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/CreateJobQueueResponse\"\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          },\n          \"480\": {\n            \"description\": \"ClientException\",\n            \"content\": {\n              \"application/json\": {\n                \"schema\": { \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/ClientException\" }\n              }\n            }\n          },\n          \"481\": {\n            \"description\": \"ServerException\",\n            \"content\": {\n              \"application/json\": {\n                \"schema\": { \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/ServerException\" }\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        },\n        \"parameters\": [],\n        \"requestBody\": {\n          \"required\": true,\n          \"content\": {\n            \"application/json\": {\n              \"schema\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"required\": [\n                  \"jobQueueName\",\n                  \"priority\",\n                  \"computeEnvironmentOrder\"\n                ],\n                \"properties\": {\n                  \"jobQueueName\": {\n                    \"description\": \"The name of the job queue.\",\n                    \"type\": \"string\"\n                  },\n                  \"state\": {\n                    \"description\": \"The state of the job queue.

For example, \u003ccode\u003ejd1\u003c/code\u003e matches only \u003ccode\u003ejd1\u003c/code\u003e, and \u003ccode\u003ejd1*\u003c/code\u003e matches both \u003ccode\u003ejd1\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003ejd1A\u003c/code\u003e.
