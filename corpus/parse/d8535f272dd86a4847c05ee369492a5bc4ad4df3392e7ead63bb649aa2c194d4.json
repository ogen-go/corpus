Please\n    ensure:\n\n\n    - Your account is activated for API access. You can do so on our [Global\n    Portal](https://app.voxbone.com/home). If you have trouble, reach out to\n    your account manager or raise a support ticket.\n\n    - You've setup an API key. You can generate your API key under **Settings \u003e\n    API**.\n\n\n    ## Environments\n\n\n    There are currently two environments for our global APIs:\n\n\n    | Environment | Base URL | Description |\n\n    | --- | --- | --- |\n\n    | Production | https://api.voxbone.com | Live production network. |\n\n    | Sandbox | https://api.sandbox.voxbone.com | Intended for simulating\n    ordering and address verification. You can test ordering without being\n    charged, service activation and more. Any API calls performed through our\n    Sandbox API can be viewed via our [Sandbox\n    Portal](https://sandbox.voxbone.com/sandbox-v3/). |\n\n\n    ## Security \u0026 Rate Limiting\n\n     For protecting both your apps and our systems, a __20 requests per second by client IP__ is performed on your API calls. If you send more requests, your requests may be rejected by an `HTTP 509 Bandwidth Limit Exceeded` or `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` in the response.\n  contact:\n    name: Bandwidth\n  version: '1.0'\nservers:\n  - url: https://api.voxbone.com/v2\ntags:\n  - name: CDRs\n    description: \u003e\n      With each CDR being provided in real-time, you can integrate the data into\n      your internal platform, using call quality metrics to identify call\n      experience issues before your customers or end-users do. You can also use\n      our API to perform instant billing or reconciliation.\npaths:\n  /cdr/calls:\n    get:\n      tags:\n        - CDRs\n      summary: List CDRs with filters\n      description: List CDRs with filters\n      operationId: searchCdrsExternalUsingGET\n      parameters:\n        -
