Routing is the process of finding the best path connecting\n      two or more points, where the meaning of ''best'' depends on the vehicle and use case.\n\n      ### Navigation\n      If you plan to use the Routing API for navigation, have a look at our [open source demo navigation application](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-navigation-example) and adapt it to your needs.\n\n      ### Fast\n      To get started using this API, just provide two or more points and retrieve the fastest route through the road\n      network that connects them. This type of request is heavily optimized for query performance, so it does not\n      allow for some advanced features.\n      ### Flexible\n      Unlock further flexible features via `ch.disable=true`.\n  - name: Matrix API\n    description: |2\n\n      ### Introduction\n\n      ![Matrix Example](./img/matrix-example.png)\n\n      The Matrix API is part of the [GraphHopper Directions API](https://graphhopper.com/#directions-api) and with\n      it you can calculate many-to-many distances and times a lot more efficient than calling the\n      Routing API multiple times.\n\n      In the [Routing API](#tag/Routing-API) we support multiple points, so called 'via points', which results in one\n      route being calculated. The Matrix API results in NxM routes, or more precise NxM distances or times being calculated\n      but [is a lot faster](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2019/06/04/incredibly-fast-distance-matrix-calculations-with-graphhopper/)\n      compared to NxM single requests.\n\n      The most simple example is a tourist trying to decide\n      which pizza is close to her instead of using beeline distance she can calculate a 1x4 matrix. Or a delivery service\n      often in the need of big NxN matrices to solve vehicle routing problems. For example the [GraphHopper Route Optimization API](#tag/Route-Optimization-API)\n      uses the Matrix API under the hood to achieve this.\n\n      Some other use cases for the Matrix API:\n\n      * Logistic problems often pick up many items from and deliver them to many locations.\n      * Calculating detours with many possible points in-between and selecting the best e.g. interesting for ridesharing or taxi applications. For this 1-to-many requests are necessary.\n      * Finding the best tour for a tourist in the need to visit as many points of interests as possible.\n      * ...\n\n      ### API Clients and Examples\n\n      See the [clients](#section/API-Clients) section in the main document and [live examples](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/examples/#matrix).\n\n      ### Description\n\n      The Matrix API calculates the well known distance-matrix for a set of points, i.e. it calculates all the distances\n      between every point combination. But we do not stop there, we also offer a time-, weight- and route-matrix.\n      The weight-matrix can be used as raw input for e.g. a vehicle routing problem ([VRP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem))\n      and is more precise than a time- or distance-matrix. E.g. for bike routes the actual weight of a route (e.g. the \"beauty\")\n      is what you want to decide if a route is 'better' and not always the taken time or distance.\n\n      A simple illustration for a 3x3 matrix with identical from and to points:\n\n      -          |to_point1|to_point2|to_point3\n      :-----------|:--------|:--------|:--------\n      from_point1 |0        |1-\u003e2     | 1-\u003e3\n      from_point2 |2-\u003e1     |0        | 2-\u003e3\n      from_point3 |3-\u003e1     |3-\u003e2     | 0\n\n      A simple illustration for a 1x3 matrix with different start- and end-points:\n\n      -          | to_point1  | to_point2 | t_point3\n      :-----------|:-----------|:----------|:--------\n      from_pointA |A-\u003e1        |A-\u003e2       |A-\u003e3\n\n\n      For every route 1-\u003e2, 1-3, ... or A-\u003e1,A-\u003e2,A-\u003e3 you can return only the weight, the time and the distance.\n      To calculate full routes you can use the [Routing API](#tag/Routing-API).\n\n      ### Limits and Counts\n\n      The cost for one request depends on the number of locations and is documented [here](https://support.graphhopper.com/support/solutions/44000303787#what-is-one-credit).\n\n      One request should not exceed the Matrix API location limit, which depends on the subscription, see the\n      pricing tab in our dashboard.\n  - name: Geocoding API\n    description: Everything about geocoding\n  - name: Isochrone API\n    description: Everything about isochrones\n  - name: Map Matching API\n    description: Everything about map matching aka \"snap to road\"\n  - name: Cluster API\n    description: |2\n\n      ### Introduction\n\n      ![Cluster Example](./img/cluster-solution.jpg)\n\n      It solves the “capacity clustering problem” by assigning a set of customers to a given number of distinct groups (called clusters).\n      The API “clusters” by minimizing the total distance from each individual customer to its designated group median.\n      It can also consider minimum and maximum capacity restrictions for each group.\n\n      Clustering can be used in many practical applications.\n      For example, it can help to plan territories, i.e. territory optimization for field teams with large territories for field workers,\n      or to solve large vehicle routing problems (VRP).\nsecurity:\n  - api_key: []\npaths:\n  \"/route\":\n    get:\n      summary: GET Route Endpoint\n      operationId: getRoute\n      description: |\n        The GET request is the most simple one: just specify the parameter in the URL and you are done.\n        Can be tried directly in every browser.\n      parameters:\n        - name: point\n          in: query\n          description: |\n            The points for which the route should be calculated.

Read more at Wikipedia.\n#\n#        In the example screenshot above and demo you see the Map Matching API in action where the black line is the GPS track and the green one is matched result.\n#\n#        Most of the times, you can simply POST a GPX file, but some of the request parameters of the [Routing API](#tag/Routing-API) apply here, too.\n#\n#        ### API Clients and Examples\n#        See the [clients](#section/API-Clients) section in the main documentation, and [live examples](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/examples/#map-matching).\n#\n#        ### Limits and Counts\n#        The cost for one request depends on the number of GPS location and is documented [here](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/docs/FAQ/).\n#\n#        One request should not exceed the Map Matching API location limit depending on the package, see the pricing in our dashboard.\n#      parameters:\n#        - name: gps_accuracy\n#          in: query\n#          description: Specify the precision of a point, in meter\n#          required: false\n#          schema:\n#            type: integer\n#        - name: vehicle\n#          in: query\n#          description: Specify the vehicle profile like car\n#          required: false\n#          schema:\n#            type: string\n#      tags:\n#        - Map Matching API\n#      responses:\n#        '200':\n#          description: Routing Result\n#          content:\n#            application/json:\n#              schema:\n#                \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/RouteResponse\"\n#          headers:\n#            X-RateLimit-Limit:\n#              description: Your current daily credit limit.\n#              schema:\n#                type: integer\n#            X-RateLimit-Remaining:\n#              description: Your remaining credits until the reset.\n#              schema:\n#                type: integer\n#            X-RateLimit-Reset:\n#              description: The number of seconds that you have to wait before a reset\n#                of the credit count is done.\n#              schema:\n#                type: integer\n#            X-RateLimit-Credits:\n#              description: The credit costs for this request.

E.g. `osm_tag=tourism:museum`\n#          or just the key `osm_tag=tourism`.

You can try\n#          this provider [here](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/). The provider\n#          does **not** fall under the [restrictions](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/)\n#          of the Nominatim instance hosted by OpenStreetMap.\\n\\nIn addition to the\n#          above documented parameters Nominatim allows to use the following parameters,\n#          which can be used as documented [here](https://github.com/openstreetmap/Nominatim/blob/master/docs/api/Search.md#parameters):\\n\\n*\n#          `viewbox` - the expected format is `minLon,minLat,maxLon,maxLat`\\n* `bounded`\n#          - If 1 and a viewbox is given, restrict the result to items contained within\n#          that viewbox. Default is 0.\\n\\n#### Gisgraphy (`provider=gisgraphy`)\\n\\nThis\n#          provider returns results from the Gisgraphy geocoder which you can try [here](https://services.gisgraphy.com/static/leaflet/index.html).\\n\\n**Limitations:**\n#          The `locale` parameter is not supported. Gisgraphy does not return OSM tags\n#          or an extent.\\n\\nGisgraphy has a special autocomplete API, which you can\n#          use by adding `autocomplete=true` (does not work with `reverse=true`). The\n#          autocomplete API is optimized on predicting text input, but returns less\n#          information.\\n\\nIn addition to the above documented parameters Gisgraphy\n#          allows to use the following parameters, which can be used as documented\n#          [here](https://www.gisgraphy.com/documentation/user-guide.php#geocodingservice):\\n\\n*\n#          `radius` - radius in meters\\n* `country` - restrict search for the specified\n#          country. The value must be the ISO 3166 Alpha 2 code of the country.\\n\\n####\n#          NetToolKit (`provider=nettoolkit`)\\n\\nThis provider returns results from\n#          the NetToolKit provider which is specialized for US addresses and provides\n#          a wrapper around Nominatim for other addresses. You can try it [here](https://www.nettoolkit.com/geo/demo).\\n\\nThe\n#          following additional NetToolKit parameters are supported (read [here](https://www.nettoolkit.com/docs/geo/geocoding)\n#          for more details):\\n- `source`: User can choose which source provider to\n#          geocode the address, this value is \\\"NetToolKit\\\" by default\\n- `country_code`:\n#          an iso-3166-2 country code (e.g : US) filter the results to the specify\n#          country code\\n\\n**Limitations:** NetToolKit does not support the `locale`\n#          parameter. NetToolKit does not return OSM tags (e.g. osm_id, osm_type, osm_value).\\n\\n####\n#          OpenCage Data (`provider=opencagedata`)\\n\\nThis provider returns results\n#          from the OpenCageData geocoder which you can try [here](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/demo).\\n\\nIn\n#          addition to the above documented parameters OpenCage Data allows to use\n#          the following parameters, which can be used as documented [here](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/api#forward-opt):\\n\\n*\n#          countrycode - The country code is a two letter code as defined by the ISO\n#          3166-1 Alpha 2 standard.

In case of one vehicle, switching from `min` to `min-max` should not have any impact.\n            If you have more than one vehicle, then the algorithm tries to constantly move stops from one vehicle to another such that\n            the completion time of longest vehicle route can be further reduced. For example, if you have one vehicle that takes 8 hours\n            to serve all customers, adding another vehicle (and using `min-max`) might halve the time to serve all customers to 4 hours. However,\n            this usually comes with higher transport costs.\n\n            If you want to minimize `vehicles` first and, second, `completion_time`, you can also combine different objectives like this:\n\n            ```json\n            \"objectives\" : [\n               {\n                  \"type\": \"min\",\n                  \"value\": \"vehicles\"\n               },\n               {\n                  \"type\": \"min\",\n                  \"value\": \"completion_time\"\n               }\n            ]\n            ```\n\n            If you want to balance activities or the number of stops among all employed drivers, you need to specify it as follows:\n\n            ```json\n            \"objectives\" : [\n               {\n                  \"type\": \"min-max\",\n                  \"value\": \"completion_time\"\n               },\n               {\n                  \"type\": \"min-max\",\n                  \"value\": \"activities\"\n               }\n            ]\n            ```\n          default: min\n          enum:\n            - min\n            - min-max\n        value:\n          type: string\n          default: transport_time\n          description: |\n            The value of the objective function.\n            The objective value `transport_time` solely considers the time\n            your drivers spend on the road, i.e. transport time. In contrary to `transport_time`, `completion_time` also takes waiting times at customer sites into account.\n            The `completion_time` of a route is defined as the time from starting to ending the route,\n            i.e. the route's transport time, the sum of waiting times plus the sum of activity durations.\n            Note that choosing `transport_time` or `completion_time` only makes a difference if you specified time windows for your services/shipments since only in\n            scenarios with time windows waiting times can occur.\n            The objective value `vehicles` can only be used along with `min` and minimizes vehicles.\n          enum:\n            - completion_time\n            - transport_time\n            - vehicles\n            - activities\n      example:\n        type: min\n        value: vehicles\n      required:\n        - type\n        - value\n    CostMatrix:\n      type: object\n      properties:\n        type:\n          type: string\n          description: type of cost matrix, currently default or google are supported\n          enum:\n            - default\n            - google\n        location_ids:\n          type: array\n          items:\n            type: string\n        data:\n          type: object\n          description: JSON data of matrix response\n          properties:\n            times:\n              minItems: 1\n              type: array\n              items:\n                type: array\n                items:\n                  type: integer\n                  format: int64\n            distances:\n              minItems: 1\n              type: array\n              items:\n                type: array\n                items:\n                  type: number\n                  format: double\n            info:\n              type: object\n              description: Additional information for your request\n              properties:\n                copyrights:\n                  type: array\n                  items:\n                    type: string\n                took:\n                  type: number\n                  format: double\n        profile:\n          type: string\n          description: vehicle profile or empty if catch all fallback\n    GroupRelation:\n      type: object\n      properties:\n        type:\n          type: string\n          description: 'Specifies the type of relation.

It can be specified as follows:\n\n            ```json\n            {\n               \"type\": \"in_same_route\",\n               \"ids\": [\"serv_i_id\",\"serv_j_id\"]\n            }\n            ```\n\n            This enforces service i to be in the same route as service j no matter which vehicle will be employed. If a specific vehicle (driver) is required to conduct this, just add a `vehicle_id` like this:\n\n            ```\n            {\n               \"type\": \"in_same_route\",\n               \"ids\": [\"serv_i_id\",\"serv_j_id\"],\n               \"vehicle_id\": \"vehicle1\"\n            }\n            ```\n\n            This not only enforce service i and j to be in the same route, but also makes sure that both services are in the route of `vehicle1`.\n\n            *Tip*: This way initial loads and vehicle routes can be modelled. For example, if your vehicles are already on the road and new orders come in, then vehicles can still be rescheduled subject to the orders that have already been assigned to these vehicles.\n\n\n\n            `in_sequence`: This relation type enforces n jobs to be in sequence. It can be specified as\n\n            ```json\n            {\n               \"type\": \"in_sequence\",\n               \"ids\": [\"serv_i_id\",\"serv_j_id\"]\n            }\n            ```\n\n            which means that service j need to be in the same route as service i AND it needs to occur somewhere after service i. As described above if a specific vehicle needs to conduct this, just add `vehicle_id`.\n\n\n            `in_direct_sequence`: This enforces n services or shipments to be in direct sequence. It can be specified as\n\n            ```json\n            {\n               \"type\": \"in_direct_sequence\",\n               \"ids\": [\"serv_i_id\",\"serv_j_id\",\"serv_k_id\"]\n            }\n            ```\n\n            yielding service j to occur directly after service i, and service k to occur directly after service j i.e. in strong order. Again, a vehicle can be assigned a priority by adding a `vehicle_id` to the relation.\n\n\n            *Special IDs*:\n            If you look at the previous example and you want service i to be the first in the route, use the special ID `start` as follows:\n\n            ```json\n            {\n               \"type\": \"in_direct_sequence\",\n               \"ids\": [\"start\",\"serv_i_id\",\"serv_j_id\",\"serv_k_id\"]\n            }\n            ```\n\n            Latter enforces the direct sequence of i, j and k at the beginning of the route. If this sequence should be bound to the end of the route, use the special ID `end` like this:\n\n            ```json\n            {\n               \"type\": \"in_direct_sequence\",\n               \"ids\": [\"serv_i_id\",\"service_j_id\",\"serv_k_id\",\"end\"]\n            }\n            ```\n\n            If you deal with services then you need to use the 'id' of your services in the field 'ids'. To also consider sequences of the pickups and deliveries of your shipments, you need to use a special ID, i.e. use the shipment id plus the keyword `_pickup` or `_delivery`. For example, to ensure that the pickup and delivery of the shipment with the id 'my_shipment' are direct neighbors, you need the following specification:\n\n            ```\n            {\n               \"type\": \"in_direct_sequence\",\n               \"ids\": [\"my_ship_pickup\",\"my_ship_delivery\"]\n            }\n            ```\n\n          example: in_direct_sequence\n        ids:\n          type: array\n          description: Specifies an array of shipment and/or service ids that are\n            in relation.
