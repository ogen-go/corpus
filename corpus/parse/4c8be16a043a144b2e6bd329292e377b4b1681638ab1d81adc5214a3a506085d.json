The 'matches' operator indicates that the value\n            is a regular expression to be evaluated. If value is a list type,\n            then at least one evaluation must be true (equivalent to OR).\n            This means that the == operator with a list acts like a SQL 'IN'\n            clause. If the value of the compared attribute is a list, then\n            comparisons are performed between each of the constraint values\n            and each of the attribute values, and any one true evaluation\n            counts as an overall true (e.g., [1,2,3] == [6,7,2] is true).\n            The == operator is therefore a broad interpretation of inclusion.\n            The '===' operator requires that the constraint value and\n            the attribute value be the same data type, length,\n            content, and order (e.g. only [1,2,3] === [1,2,3]).\n            The 'not' property negates the operator such that not\n            and == means 'not equal to' (or 'not in' for a list), and not \u003e\n            means \u003c=, and not \u003c means \u003e=, not matches means does not\n            match, and not === means the match between the constraint\n            and attribute values are not exact.\n            The '==' operator SHOULD NOT be used in a manner that\n            describes an \"is a\" subclass relationship for the parent QNode.\n          enum:\n            - ==\n            - '\u003e'\n            - \u003c\n            - matches\n            - ===\n        value:\n          example: 57.0\n          description: \u003e-\n            Value of the attribute.

If 'value' is of data\n            type 'object', the keys of the object MAY be treated as a list.\n            A 'list' data type paired with the '\u003e' or '\u003c' operators will\n            encode extraneous comparisons, but this is permitted as it is in\n            SQL and other languages.\n        unit_id:\n          example: UO:0000222\n          description: \u003e-\n            CURIE of the units of the value or list of values in the 'value'\n            property.
