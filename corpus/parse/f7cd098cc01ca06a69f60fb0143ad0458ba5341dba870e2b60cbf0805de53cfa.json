This instance will use jmeter to execute the provided test plan    \n\npaths:\n  /simulations:\n    post:\n      tags:\n      - \"Simulations\"\n      summary: \"Create a new Simulation.\"\n      operationId: \"CreateSimulation\"\n      requestBody:\n        $ref: '#/components/requestBodies/Simulation'\n      responses:\n        204:\n          description : \"success\"\n          headers: \n            location:\n              schema:\n                type: \"string\"\n            \ncomponents:\n\n  requestBodies:\n    Simulation:\n      content:\n        application/vnd.aws-cdf-v1.0+json:\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Simulation\"\n      \n  schemas:\n    Simulation:\n      type: \"object\"\n      properties:\n        name:\n          type: \"string\"\n          description: \"name of the simulation\"\n        deviceCount:\n          type: \"integer\"\n          format: \"int64\"\n          description: \"The number of devices to run the simulation for\"\n          default: 1\n        modules:\n          type: \"object\"\n          description: \"A list of key: value s listing the modules that the simulation needs to execute.
