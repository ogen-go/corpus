When the Asset Report is ready to be retrieved using `/asset_report/get` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, Plaid will fire a `PRODUCT_READY` webhook. For full details of the webhook schema, see [Asset Report webhooks](/docs/api/webhooks/#Assets-webhooks).\n\n        The `/asset_report/create` endpoint creates an Asset Report at a moment in time. Asset Reports are immutable. To get an updated Asset Report, use the `/asset_report/refresh` endpoint.\n      externalDocs:\n        url: /api/products/#asset_reportcreate\n      operationId: assetReportCreate\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/AssetReportCreateRequest'\n        required: true\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              examples:\n                example-1:\n                  value:\n                    asset_report_id: 1f414183-220c-44f5-b0c8-bc0e6d4053bb\n                    asset_report_token: assets-sandbox-6f12f5bb-22dd-4855-b918-f47ec439198a\n                    request_id: Iam3b\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/AssetReportCreateResponse'\n          description: OK\n      summary: Create an Asset Report\n      tags:\n        - plaid\n  /asset_report/filter:\n    post:\n      description: |-\n        By default, an Asset Report will contain all of the accounts on a given Item. In some cases, you may not want the Asset Report to contain all accounts. For example, you might have the end user choose which accounts are relevant in Link using the Select Account view, which you can enable in the dashboard. Or, you might always exclude certain account types or subtypes, which you can identify by using the `/accounts/get` endpoint. To narrow an Asset Report to only a subset of accounts, use the `/asset_report/filter` endpoint.\n\n        To exclude certain Accounts from an Asset Report, first use the `/asset_report/create` endpoint to create the report, then send the `asset_report_token` along with a list of `account_ids` to exclude to the `/asset_report/filter` endpoint, to create a new Asset Report which contains only a subset of the original Asset Report's data.\n\n        Because Asset Reports are immutable, calling `/asset_report/filter` does not alter the original Asset Report in any way; rather, `/asset_report/filter` creates a new Asset Report with a new token and id. Asset Reports created via `/asset_report/filter` do not contain new Asset data, and are not billed.\n\n        Plaid will fire a [`PRODUCT_READY`](/docs/api/webhooks) webhook once generation of the filtered Asset Report has completed.\n      externalDocs:\n        url: /api/products/#asset_reportfilter\n      operationId: assetReportFilter\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/AssetReportFilterRequest'\n        description: ''\n        required: true\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              examples:\n                example-1:\n                  value:\n                    asset_report_id: fdc09207-0cef-4d88-b5eb-0d970758ebd9\n                    asset_report_token: assets-sandbox-bc410c6a-4653-4c75-985c-e757c3497c5c\n                    request_id: qEg07\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/AssetReportFilterResponse'\n          description: OK\n      summary: Filter Asset Report\n      tags:\n        - plaid\n  /asset_report/get:\n    post:\n      description: |-\n        The `/asset_report/get` endpoint retrieves the Asset Report in JSON format.

You can also receive cleaned and categorized transactions, as well as additional insights like merchant name or location information. We call this an Asset Report with Insights. An Asset Report with Insights provides transaction category, location, and merchant information in addition to the transaction strings provided in a standard Asset Report.\n\n        To retrieve an Asset Report with Insights, call the `/asset_report/get` endpoint with `include_insights` set to `true`.

Currently supported account types are account type `credit` with account subtype `credit card` or `paypal`, and account type `loan` with account subtype `student` or `mortgage`. To limit accounts listed in Link to types and subtypes supported by Liabilities, you can use the `account_filter` parameter when [creating a Link token](/docs/api/tokens/#linktokencreate).\n\n        The types of information returned by Liabilities can include balances and due dates, loan terms, and account details such as original loan amount and guarantor.

Payments can be one-time or standing order (recurring) and can be denominated in either EUR or GBP.  If making domestic GBP-denominated payments, your recipient must have been created with BACS numbers. In general, EUR-denominated payments will be sent via SEPA Credit Transfer and GBP-denominated payments will be sent via the Faster Payments network, but the payment network used will be determined by the institution. Payments sent via Faster Payments will typically arrive immediately, while payments sent via SEPA Credit Transfer will typically arrive in one business day.\n\n        Standing orders (recurring payments) must be denominated in GBP and can only be sent to recipients in the UK. Once created, standing order payments will continue indefinitely and cannot be modified or canceled via the API. An end user can cancel or modify a standing order directly on their banking application or website, or by contacting the bank. Standing orders will follow the payment rules of the underlying rails (Faster Payments in UK). Payments can be sent Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays. If the pre-arranged date falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the payment is made on the next working day. It is not possible to guarantee the exact time the payment will reach the recipient’s account, although at least 90% of standing order payments are sent by 6am.\n\n        In the Development environment, payments must be below 5 GBP / EUR.

For transaction history from investments accounts, use the [Investments endpoint](/docs/api/products#investments) instead. Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.\n\n        Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).\n\n        Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.\n\n        Data returned by `/transactions/get` will be the data available for the Item as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. An Item's `status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.\n\n        Note that data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to `/transactions/get`, if it wasn't. To be alerted when transaction data is ready to be fetched, listen for the [`INITIAL_UPDATE`](/docs/api/webhooks#transactions-initial_update) and [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](/docs/api/webhooks#transactions-historical_update) webhooks. If no transaction history is ready when `/transactions/get` is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.\n      externalDocs:\n        url: /api/products/#transactionsget\n      operationId: transactionsGet\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            examples: {}\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/TransactionsGetRequest'\n        required: true\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              examples:\n                example-1:\n                  value:\n                    accounts:\n                      -

plaid\n  /transactions/refresh:\n    post:\n      description: |-\n        `/transactions/refresh` is an optional endpoint for users of the Transactions product. It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for an Item. This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur multiple times a day for any Transactions-enabled Item. If changes to transactions are discovered after calling `/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](/docs/api/webhooks#deleted-transactions-detected) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](/docs/api/webhooks#transactions-default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling `/transactions/get`.\n\n        Access to `/transactions/refresh` in Production is specific to certain pricing plans.
