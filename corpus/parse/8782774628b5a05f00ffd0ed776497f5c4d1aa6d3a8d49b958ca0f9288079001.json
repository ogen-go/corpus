However, an error\n\n            in one batch will not affect other batches within the same request.\n\n\n            For each object, its `updated_at` field is ignored and replaced with a current [timestamp](#workingwithdates), and its\n\n            `is_deleted` field must not be set to `true`.\n\n\n            To modify an existing object, supply its ID.

For example, you can create a [CatalogItem](#type-catalogitem) with\n\n            ID `#ABC` and a [CatalogItemVariation](#type-catalogitemvariation) with its `item_id` attribute set to\n\n            `#ABC` in order to associate the [CatalogItemVariation](#type-catalogitemvariation) with its parent\n\n            [CatalogItem](#type-catalogitem).\n\n\n            Any `#`-prefixed IDs are valid only within a single atomic batch, and will be replaced by server-generated IDs.\n\n\n            Each batch may contain up to 1,000 objects. The total number of objects across all batches for a single request\n\n            may not exceed 10,000.
