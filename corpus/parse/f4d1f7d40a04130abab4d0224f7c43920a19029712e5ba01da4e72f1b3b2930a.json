In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least restrictive to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet all requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or Accept the HIT. ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the \u003ccode\u003eRequiredToPreview\u003c/code\u003e field. '\n      description: ' The QualificationRequirement data structure describes a Qualification that a Worker must have before the Worker is allowed to accept a HIT.
