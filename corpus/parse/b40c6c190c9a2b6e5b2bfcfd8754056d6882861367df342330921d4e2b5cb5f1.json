This applies in the following scenarios:\n\n          * The ASPSP has indicated with a 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceding payment \n            initiation response that an explicit start

ASPSP.\n\n        ## Variants of payment initiation requests\n\n        This method to initiate a payment initiation at the ASPSP can be sent with either a JSON body or an pain.001 body depending on the payment product in the path.\n\n        There are the following **payment products**:\n\n          - Payment products with payment information in *JSON* format:\n            - ***domestic-swiss-credit-transfers-isr***\n            - ***domestic-swiss-credit-transfers***\n            - ***domestic-swiss-credit-transfers-qr***\n            - ***domestic-swiss-foreign-credit-transfers***\n            - ***swiss-sepa-credit-transfers***\n            - ***swiss-cross-border-credit-transfers***\n          - Payment products with payment information in *SIX pain.001* XML format:\n            - ***pain.001-sepa-credit-transfers***\n            - ***pain.001-cross-border-credit-transfers***\n            - ***pain.001-swiss-six-credit-transfers***\n\n        Furthermore the request body depends on the **payment-service**:\n          * ***payments***: A single payment initiation request.\n          * ***bulk-payments***: A collection of several payment initiation requests.\n          \n            In case of a *pain.001* message there are more than one payments contained in the *pain.001 message.\n\n            In case of a *JSON* there are several JSON payment blocks contained in a joining list.\n          * ***periodic-payments***:\n            Create a standing order initiation resource for recurrent i.e. periodic payments addressable under {paymentId}\n             with all data relevant for the corresponding payment product and the execution of the standing order contained in a JSON body.\n\n        This is the first step in the API to initiate the related recurring/periodic payment.\n\n        ## Single and mulitilevel SCA Processes\n\n        The payment initiation requests are independent from the need of one or multilevel \n        SCA processing, i.e. independent from the number of authorisations needed for the execution of payments. \n\n        But the response messages are specific to either one SCA processing or multilevel SCA processing. \n\n        For payment initiation with multilevel SCA, this specification requires an explicit start of the authorisation, \n        i.e. links directly associated with SCA processing like 'scaRedirect' or 'scaOAuth' cannot be contained in the \n        response message of a Payment Initation Request for a payment, where multiple authorisations are needed. \n        Also if any data is needed for the next action, like selecting an SCA method is not supported in the response, \n        since all starts of the multiple authorisations are fully equal. \n        In these cases, first an authorisation sub-resource has to be generated following the 'startAuthorisation' link.\n      operationId:

needed. \n        It may authorise a cancellation of the payment within the Embedded SCA Approach where needed.\n\n        Independently from the SCA Approach it supports e.g. the selection of\n        the authentication method and a non-SCA PSU authentication.\n\n        There are several possible update PSU data requests in the context of a cancellation authorisation within the payment initiation services needed, \n        which depends on the SCA approach:\n\n        * Redirect SCA Approach:\n          A specific Update PSU data request is applicable for \n            * the selection of authentication methods, before choosing the actual SCA approach.\n        * Decoupled SCA Approach:\n          A specific Update PSU data request is only applicable for\n          * adding the PSU Identification, if not provided yet in the payment initiation request or the Account Information Consent Request, or if no OAuth2 access token is used, or\n          * the selection of authentication methods.\n        * Embedded SCA Approach: \n          The Update PSU data request might be used \n          * to add credentials as a first factor authentication data of the PSU and\n          * to select the authentication method and\n          * transaction authorisation.\n\n        The SCA approach might depend on the chosen SCA method. \n        For that reason, the following possible update PSU data request can apply to all SCA approaches:\n\n        * Select an SCA method in case of several SCA methods are available for the customer.\n\n        There are the following request types on this access path:\n          * Update PSU identification\n          * Update PSU authentication\n          * Select PSU autorization method \n            WARNING: This method needs a reduced header,
