For example, you can use <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code> to create a resource record set that routes traffic for test.example.com to a web server that has an IP address of 192.0.2.44.</p> <p> <b>Deleting Resource Record Sets</b> </p> <p>To delete a resource record set, you must specify all the same values that you specified when you created it.</p> <p> <b>Change Batches and Transactional Changes</b> </p> <p>The request body must include a document with a <code>ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest</code> element. The request body contains a list of change items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered transactional changes. Route 53 validates the changes in the request and then either makes all or none of the changes in the change batch request. This ensures that DNS routing isn''t adversely affected by partial changes to the resource record sets in a hosted zone. </p> <p>For example, suppose a change batch request contains two changes: it deletes the <code>CNAME</code> resource record set for www.example.com and creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. If validation for both records succeeds, Route 53 deletes the first resource record set and creates the second resource record set in a single operation. If validation for either the <code>DELETE</code> or the <code>CREATE</code> action fails, then the request is canceled, and the original <code>CNAME</code> record continues to exist.</p> <note> <p>If you try to delete the same resource record set more than once in a single change batch, Route 53 returns an <code>InvalidChangeBatch</code> error.</p> </note> <p> <b>Traffic Flow</b> </p> <p>To create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use either the traffic flow visual editor in the Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save the configuration as a traffic policy, then associate the traffic policy with one or more domain names (such as example.com) or subdomain names (such as www.example.com), in the same hosted zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll back the updates if the new configuration isn''t performing as expected. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/traffic-flow.html\">Using Traffic Flow to Route DNS Traffic</a> in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Create, Delete, and Upsert</b> </p> <p>Use <code>ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest</code> to perform the following actions:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>CREATE</code>: Creates a resource record set that has the specified values.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DELETE</code>: Deletes an existing resource record set that has the specified values.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>UPSERT</code>: If a resource record set does not already exist, Amazon Web Services creates it. If a resource set does exist, Route 53 updates it with the values in the request. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Syntaxes for Creating, Updating, and Deleting Resource Record Sets</b> </p> <p>The syntax for a request depends on the type of resource record set that you want to create, delete, or update, such as weighted, alias, or failover. The XML elements in your request must appear in the order listed in the syntax. </p> <p>For an example for each type of resource record set, see \"Examples.\"</p> <p>Don''t refer to the syntax in the \"Parameter Syntax\" section, which includes all of the elements for every kind of resource record set that you can create, delete, or update by using <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code>. </p> <p> <b>Change Propagation to Route 53 DNS Servers</b> </p> <p>When you submit a <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code> request, Route 53 propagates your changes to all of the Route 53 authoritative DNS servers. While your changes are propagating, <code>GetChange</code> returns a status of <code>PENDING</code>. When propagation is complete, <code>GetChange</code> returns a status of <code>INSYNC</code>. Changes generally propagate to all Route 53 name servers within 60 seconds.

When you register an EC2 instance with a load balancer, you configure settings for an ELB health check, which performs a similar function to a Route 53 health check.</p> <p> <b>Private Hosted Zones</b> </p> <p>You can associate health checks with failover resource record sets in a private hosted zone. Note the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the health of an endpoint within a VPC by IP address, you must assign a public IP address to the instance in the VPC.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can configure a health checker to check the health of an external resource that the instance relies on, such as a database server.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm with the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm. For example, you might create a CloudWatch metric that checks the status of the Amazon EC2 <code>StatusCheckFailed</code> metric, add an alarm to the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm.

If you reach the limit and need to create another version, you''ll need to start a new traffic policy.'\n      responses:\n        '201':\n          description: Success\n          content:\n            text/xml:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/CreateTrafficPolicyVersionResponse'\n        '480':\n          description: NoSuchTrafficPolicy\n          content:\n            text/xml:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/NoSuchTrafficPolicy'\n        '481':\n          description: InvalidInput\n          content:\n            text/xml:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/InvalidInput'\n        '482':\n          description: TooManyTrafficPolicyVersionsForCurrentPolicy\n          content:\n            text/xml:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/TooManyTrafficPolicyVersionsForCurrentPolicy'\n        '483':\n          description: ConcurrentModification\n          content:\n            text/xml:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ConcurrentModification'\n        '484':\n          description: InvalidTrafficPolicyDocument\n          content:\n            text/xml:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/InvalidTrafficPolicyDocument'\n      parameters:\n        - name: Id\n          in: path\n          required: true\n          description: The ID of the traffic policy for which you want to create a new version.\n          schema:\n            type: string\n            minLength: 1\n            maxLength: 36\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          text/xml:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n              required:\n                - Document\n              properties:\n                Document:\n                  description: 'The definition of this version of the traffic policy, in JSON format.

Configuring health checks makes sense only in the following configurations:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Non-alias resource record sets</b>: You''re checking the health of a group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for all the resource record sets. </p> <p>If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.</p> <p>If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set.</p> <p>If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Alias resource record sets</b>: You specify the following settings:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You set <code>EvaluateTargetHealth</code> to true for an alias resource record set in a group of resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A). </p> </li> <li> <p>You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone.</p> </li> <li> <p>You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set. </p> </li> </ul> <p>If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.</p> <p>If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the alias resource record set.</p> <note> <p>The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a <i>group</i> of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration, associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource record sets.</p> </note> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Geolocation Routing</b> </p> <p>For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for North America, and a resource record set that has <code>*</code> for <code>CountryCode</code> is <code>*</code>, which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The United States</p> </li> <li> <p>North America</p> </li> <li> <p>The default resource record set</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name</b> </p> <p>If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each <code>HTTP</code> server that is serving content for <code>www.example.com</code>. For the value of <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>, specify the domain name of the server (such as <code>us-east-2-www.example.com</code>), not the name of the resource record sets (<code>www.example.com</code>).</p> <important> <p>Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Create a health check that has the same value for <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code> as the name of a resource record set.</p> </li> <li> <p>Associate that health check with the resource record set.</p> </li> </ul> </important>'\n        TrafficPolicyInstanceId:\n          allOf:\n            - $ref: '#/components/schemas/TrafficPolicyInstanceId'\n            - description: '<p>When you create a traffic policy instance, Amazon Route 53 automatically creates a resource record set. <code>TrafficPolicyInstanceId</code> is the ID of the traffic policy instance that Route 53 created this resource record set for.</p> <important> <p>To delete the resource record set that is associated with a traffic policy instance, use <code>DeleteTrafficPolicyInstance</code>.
