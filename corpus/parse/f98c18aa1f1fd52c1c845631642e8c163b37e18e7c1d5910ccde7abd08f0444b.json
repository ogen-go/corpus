This documentation contains all the definitions needed for interested systems and platforms to implement it.\n\n    Open Delivery does not have a server or baseURL. It is up to each company that implements the standard to use its infrastructure to host the endpoints.\n\n    This section seeks to summarize the Open Delivery documentation as a whole, helping the different parts of the integrations to understand what needs to be developed and parameterized. \n\n    First, it is recommended to read all the documentation to understand the different processes and flows of the integrations. \n\n    After reading and understanding the documentation as a whole, companies interested in implementing the standard in their platforms and systems can use this guide to assist in the implementation.\n\n    ## Parties Involved\n\n    - **ORDERING APPLICATION**: It is the platform where the final consumer will choose his items and place the order. It is responsible for reading the merchant data exposed by the SOFTWARE SERVICE and sending the orders to the SOFTWARE SERVICE as well.\n              \n    - **SOFTWARE SERVICE**: It is the merchant management platform. It is responsible for exposing the merchant data (registration data, service data, and menus) and receiving the orders from the ORDERING APPLICATION.\n\n      \u003e There may also be applications that will perform a hub function, connecting the ORDERING APPLICATION to the SOFTWARE SERVICE. In this context, these intermediate applications, can play the role of both the ORDERING APPLICATION (when communicating with a SOFTWARE SERVICE) as well as the SOFTWARE SERVICE (when communicating with the ORDERING APPLICATION).\n\n    - **LOGISTIC SERVICE**: It is the platform responsible for receiving calls for new deliveries from SOFTWARE SERVICE or ORDERING APPLICATION, and sending the tracking of the deliveries.\n\n    ## Development\n\n    Since Open Delivery is not the host of the APIs, it is up to the companies interested in using the standard to develop the Open Delivery standard APIs in their systems and platforms using this documentation as a guideline. \n\n    Listed below are the different routes offered by the Open Delivery standard and which party is responsible for being the host of it.\n    \n    | |ORDERING APPLICATION|SOFTWARE SERVICE|LOGISTIC SERVICE|\n    |-|:------------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|\n    |**[AUTHENTICATION](#tag/authentication)**|||||\n    |[POST /oauth/token](#operation/getToken)|X||X|\n    |--------------------------------||||\n    |**[LOGISTICS](#tag/logisticsSection)**|||||\n    |[POST /v1/logistics/delivery](#operation/logisticsNewDelivery)|||X|\n    |[POST /v1/logistics/orderPicked/{orderId}](#operation/logisticsPicked)|||X|\n    |[POST /v1/logistics/finishDelivery/{orderId}](#operation/logisticsFinish)|||X|\n    |[POST /v1/logistics/handleProblem/{orderId}](#operation/logisticsProblem)|||X|\n    |[POST /v1/logistics/cancel/{orderId}](#operation/logisticsCancel)|||X|\n    |[GET /v1/logistics/delivery/{orderId}](#operation/logisticDetails)|||X|\n    |[POST /v1/logistics/availability](#tag/logisticPrice)|||X|\n    |[POST /v1/deliveryUpdate](#operation/newLogisticEvent) |X|X||\n    |--------------------------------||||\n    |**[FINANCIAL RECONCILIATION](#tag/financialReportSection)**|||||\n    |[GET /v1/paymentBatchByIds](#operation/paymentBatchId)|X|||\n    |[GET /v1/paymentBatchByDate](#operation/paymentBatchDate)|X|||\n    |--------------------------------||||\n    |**[CONTRACTS](#tag/contractSection)**|||||\n    |**[Contract Summary](#tag/contractSummaryOverview)**|||||\n    |[GET /v1/contractSummary](#operation/getContractSummary)|X|||\n    |**[Sign-Up Service](#tag/contractSignupOverview)**|||||\n    |[POST /v1/signup/contractConditions](#operation/postContractConditions)|X|||\n    |[POST /v1/signup/chosenConditions](#operation/postContractChosenConditions)|X|||\n    |[GET /v1/signup/contractStatus](#operation/getContractStatus)|X|||\n    |[PUT /v1/signup/merchantAccount](#operation/putMerchantAccount)|X|||\n\n     ## Parametrizations\n\n      \u003e **IMPORTANT: Before reading this section, it is recommended the reading of the complete documentation, for a better understanding of the different required parameterizations.**\n\n      Once the endpoints are implemented, the parties interested in integrating via the Open Delivery stantard should provide some parameters for the other party to correctly connect to its routes. \n\n      Below is a list of information that each party must provide to the other party for the integrations to occur, i.e., you should consider that the information below will be created as parameters on the endpoint that will call the endpoints.\n\n      - **PARAMETERS IN THE SOFTWARE SERVICE   \n      (ORDERING APPLICATION --\u003e SOFTWARE SERVICE)**\n\n        - **{baseURL}** : The {baseURL} is the parameter that indicates the base address, i.e. the constant part of the address, where the routes will be called. The **Ordering Application** can provide up to 2 different base URLs:\n          - {baseURL} for authentication: where the token route will be hosted.\n          - {baseURL} for the other routes.\n\n          The **Ordering Application** can use only one {baseURL} if it wishes.\n        \n        - **clientId** and **clientSecret**: The **Ordering Application** is responsible for providing the credentials for authentication to be performed through the authentication endpoint. \n        \n            \u003e IMPORTANT: As described in the authentication section of the documentation, credentials must be generated BY MERCHANT and not by **Software Service**, that is, even if several MERCHANTS use the same **Software Service**, each of the MERCHANT will have a unique clientId and clientSecret.\n\n        - **AppId**: It is the unique ID of the **Ordering Application**. It must be generated by the **Ordering Application** itself, and once generated, it must be informed to all the **Software Service**S that it will integrate. Since the **AppId** is a unique key of the **Ordering Application**, you must not create oneAppId** per **Software Service**S, but the same key for all of them.\n      \u003e The companies that play the role of hub, intermediating the integrations between the **Ordering Application** and the **Software Service**, must also generate their own **AppId**, different from the **Ordering Application**'s AppId.\n\n      - **PARAMETERS IN ORDERING APPLICATION  \n      (SOFTWARE SERVICE --\u003e ORDERING APPLICATION)**\n\n        - **{baseURL} from the `GET /merchant` endpoint:** The **Ordering Application** must be provided with the {baseURL} to access the GET /merchant route to obtain the merchant's information. \n\n          \u003e IMPORTANT: Each merchant that the **Software Service** works with must have a unique {baseURL}.\n        - **apiKey**: If the GET /merchant endpoint is implemented using authentication, it is necessary that the **Software Service** provides the apiKey referring to the entered merchant.\n        \n        - **Order Event Webhook**: If both parties are going to work with sending order events via webhook, it is necessary to provide the URL of the webhook.   \n          Default webhook route:  \n\n          `POST {baseURL}/newEvent`\n\n      - **PARAMETERS IN THE SOFTWARE SERVICE/ORDERING APPLICATION  \n      (LOGISTIC SERVICE --\u003e SOFTWARE SERVICE/ORDERING APPLICATION)**\n\n      - **{baseURL}** : The {baseURL} is the parameter that indicates which is the base address, i.e. the constant part of the address, where the routes will be called. The **Logistic Service** can provide up to 2 different base URLs:\n          - {baseURL} for authentication: where the token route will be hosted.\n          - {baseURL} for the other routes.\n\n          The **Logistic Service** will be able to use only one {baseURL} if it wishes.\n        \n        - **clientId** and **clientSecret**: The **Logistic Service** is responsible for providing the credentials for authentication to be performed through the authentication endpoint. \n        \n            \u003e IMPORTANT: As described in the authentication section of the documentation, the credentials must be generated BY MERCHANT and not by **Software Service**/**Ordering Application**, that is, even if several MERCHANTS use the same **Software Service**/**Ordering Application**, each of the MERCHANT will have a unique clientId and clientSecret.\n\n        - **AppId**: It is a unique identification of the **Logistic Service**. It must be generated by the **Logistic Service** itself and once generated, it must be informed to all the **Software Service**S/**Ordering Application** to which it will integrate. As the **AppId** is a unique key of the **Logistic Service**, it must not be created an **AppId** per **Software Service**S/**Ordering Application**, but the same key must be informed for all.\n\n      - **PARAMETERS IN THE LOGISTIC SERVICE  \n      (SOFTWARE SERVICE/ORDERING APPLICATION --\u003e LOGISTIC SERVICE)**\n\n        - **Tracking Event Webhook**: It is necessary to inform the URL of the webhook to receive the tracking and event updates of the delivery order.   \n        Default webhook route:  \n        `POST {baseURL}/deliveryEvent`\n\n        - **MerchantId**: It is a unique ID of the MERCHANT. Similar to the **AppId** but for Merchant. It must be generated by **Software Service**S and once generated, it must be informed to all **Logistic Services** it will integrate with. Since the **MerchantId** is a unique key, a **MerchantId** must not be created per **Logistic Service**, but the same key must be informed for all. \n        The **Ordering Application** must send the **MerchantId** received previously through its integration with the **Software Service**.\n        \n    # └► Open Delivery API Evolution\n\n     The **Open Delivery** API seeks to respect [SemVer](https://semver.org/). In this sense, compatible changes should not generate a new major version.\n\n     The API version is composed of 4 elements: major, minor, patch and release candidate. The version v[x] in the URL path is the major element of the API version. The evolution of the version is as follows:\n\n     - **Major**: incompatible, contract-breaking changes (v1.0.0 → v2.0.0)\n     - **Minor**: compatible, non-breaking changes (v1.1.0 → v1.2.0)\n     - **Patch**: bugfixes, clarifications to specifications, no functional changes (v1.1.1 → v1.1.2)\n     - **Release candidate**: pre-release versions of any future patch, minor or major (v1.0.0-rc.1 → v1.0.0-rc.22)\n     Non-breaking changes and clarifications to specifications may occur at any time. Customers should be prepared to handle these changes without breaking.\n\n     The following changes are expected and considered backward compatible:\n\n     - Addition of new features to the **Open Delivery** API;\n     - Addition of new optional parameters;\n     - Addition of new fields in **Open Delivery** API responses;\n     - Change of fields sorting;\n     - Addition of new elements in enumerations.\n\n    # └► General Guidelines\n\n     - **Date-Time, Date and Time values**: For properties that require a Date-Time, Date or Time value, use the formats specified in date-time, date and time formats (following the [RFC3339](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14) specifications)\n      \n      \u003e **ALL DATES MUST BE SENT USING UTC AS DEFAULT.**   \n      \u003e (This way it is simpler for the receiving agent to convert to local time.)\n\n      For example:\n      \n      **2017-05-01T06:30:00Z** for date-time (As defined by date-time - [RFC3339](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14))\\\n      **2017-05-01** for date (As defined by full-date - [RFC3339](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14))\\\n      **08:08:00Z** for time (As defined by full-time - [RFC3339](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14))\n\n    - **IDs**: Use an id property to identify all unique entities within an entity type. An id is a unique identifier of the entity of that type, but across entities, IDs can overlap.\n\n    - **Null** values: Do not use the value null in place of objects. If an object is optional, you must omit it from your feed.\n\n    - **{baseURL}** : Since Open Delivery is not the host of the APIs, it is up to the companies interested in using the standard to provide the {baseURL}.

**[Confirm](#operation/confirmOrder)** receipt of order;\n  #     - Notify that an order is **[ready for pickup](#operation/orderReady)**;\n  #     - Notify that an order has been **[dispatched](#operation/dispatchOrder)**.\n\n  #     Whenever a merchant triggers one of these actions, the '**Ordering Application**' will send a new event to the mechart **Software Service**, acknowledging the new order status within the '**Ordering Application**'.\n\n  #     \u003e For `TAKEOUT` orders, it is possible to optionally assign a **pickup area** that will be informed through an event to the merchant.\n  #     \u003e This must be provided by the **Ordering Application** interface.\n\n  #     ### Order Cancellation\n\n  #     **Open Delivery** provides API's to send **[cancellation](#tag/ordersCancellation)** requests from either system.\n  #     These requests can be accepted or denied depending on the rules that the company has.\n  #   x-traitTag: true\n\n  # -

It is through this endpoint that the Software will know when the signing has occurred and whether the contracting process is proceeding successfully or not.\n\n      **6 -** Software Service performs the onboarding of the complementary registration information through the PUT /signup/merchantAccount endpoint.\n\n      **7 -** Contract between Merchant and Ordering Application becomes active, and both parties can now send and receive orders.\n\n  - name: contractSignup\n    x-displayName: └───● Actions\n    description: |-\n\n      Actions to provide a way to consult Ordering Applications contract plans and conditions, as well as signal the intention to contract a specific Ordering Application and finally perform onboarding on its plataform.\n\nx-tagGroups:\n  # - name: \"..................................................................................................................\"\n  #   tags:\n  #     - versionSection\n  #     - versionChangelog\n  # - name: \"\"\n  #   tags:\n  #     - versionsSection\n  #     - versionsEndpoint\n  - name: \"\"\n    tags:\n      - securitySection\n      - authentication\n  # - name: \"\"\n  #   tags:\n  #     - merchantSection\n  # - name: \"└──◌ Overview and Structure\"\n  #   tags:\n  #     - merchantOverview\n  #     - merchantStructure\n  # - name: \"└──◌ api\"\n  #   tags:\n  #     - merchantEndpoints\n  # - name: \"└──◌ Updates and Status\"\n  #   tags:\n  #     - merchantUpdate\n  #     - merchantStatus\n  # - name: \"\"\n  #   tags:\n  #     - ordersSection\n  # - name: \"└──◌ Overview\"\n  #   tags:\n  #     - ordersOverview\n  # - name: └──◌ Events\n  #   tags:\n  #     - ordersPolling\n  #     - ordersWebhook\n  # - name: └──◌ Details\n  #   tags:\n  #     - ordersDetails\n  # - name: └──◌ Actions\n  #  tags:\n      # - ordersStatus\n      # - ordersCancellation\n  # - name: \"..................................................................................................................\"\n  #   tags:\n  #     - versionSection2\n  #     - versionChangelog2\n  - name: \"_______________________________________\"\n    tags:\n      - logisticsSection\n  - name: └──◌ Logistics API\n    tags:\n      - logisticOverview\n      - logisticOrder\n      - logisticTracking\n      - logisticDetails\n      - logisticPrice\n  - name: \"_______________________________________\"\n    tags:\n      - financialReportSection\n  - name: \"└──◌ FINANCIAL REPORTS\"\n    tags:\n      - - financialReport\n  - name: \"_______________________________________\"\n    tags:\n      - contractSection\n  - name: \"└──◌ CONTRACT SUMMARY\"\n    tags:\n      - contractSummaryOverview\n      - contractSummary\n  - name: \"└──◌ CONTRACT SIGN-UP SERVICE\"\n    tags:\n      - contractSignupOverview\n      - contractSignup\n\n#############################################################\n\npaths:\n  # Versions\n\n  /v1/versions/orderingApp:\n    get:\n      operationId: \"getOrderingAppVersions\"\n      tags:\n        - \"versionsEndpoint\"\n      summary: \"Get Current Ordering Application API Version\"\n      description: |-\n        Requests the current version of the endpoints hosted on the **ORDERING APPLICATION** side.\n        \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n        \u003cspan style=\"text-decoration:underline;

Once you’ve obtained this token, you can provide it in the “Authorization” header of requests you make to endpoints that require client credentials scopes.\n\n        The **expiresIn** field indicates the lifetime of the access token, provided in seconds.
