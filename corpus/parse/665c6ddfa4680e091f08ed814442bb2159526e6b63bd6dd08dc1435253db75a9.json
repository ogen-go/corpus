For example, a call might assign a probability of 0.32 to the occurrence of a SNP named RS_1234 in a call set with the name NA_12345.\n      properties:\n        additionalInfo:\n          additionalProperties:\n            type: string\n          description: Additional arbitrary info\n          type: object\n        callSetDbId:\n          description: |-\n            The ID of the call set this variant call belongs to.\n\n            If this field is not present, the ordering of the call sets from a `SearchCallSetsRequest` over this `VariantSet` is guaranteed to match the ordering of the calls on this `Variant`.
