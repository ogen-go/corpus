Ask yield is calculated using the Bid on all possible call dates.\n                        It is assumed that prepayment occurs if the bond has call or put provisions and the issuer can offer a lower coupon rate based on current market rates.\n                        The yield to worst will be the lowest of the yield to maturity or yield to call (if the bond has prepayment provisions). Yield to worse may be the same as yield to maturity but never higher.\n                    7741:\n                      type: string\n                      description: Prior Close - Yesterday's closing price\n                    7762:\n                      type: string\n                      description: Volume Long - High precision volume for the day.\n                        For formatted volume refer to field 87.\n                    7768:\n                      type: string\n                      description: hasTradingPermissions - if user has trading permissions\n                        for specified contract.
