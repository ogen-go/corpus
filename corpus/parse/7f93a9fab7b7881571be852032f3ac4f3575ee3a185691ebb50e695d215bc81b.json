Items have both Stats and a\n        reference to a Stat Group, and it is the Stat Group that takes the raw\n        stat information and gives it both rendering metadata (such as whether\n        to show it as a number or a progress bar) and the final transformation\n        data (interpolation tables to turn the raw investment stat into a\n        display stat). Please see DestinyStatGroupDefinition for more\n        information on that transformational process.\\r\n\n        Stats are segregated from Stat Groups because different items\n        and types of items can refer to the same stat, but have different\n        \\\"scales\\\" for the stat while still having the same underlying value.\n        For example, both a Shotgun and an Auto Rifle may have a \\\"raw\\\" impact\n        stat of 50, but the Auto Rifle's Stat Group will scale that 50 down so\n        that, when it is displayed, it is a smaller value relative to the\n        shotgun. (this is a totally made up example, don't assume shotguns have\n        naturally higher impact than auto rifles because of this)\\r\n\n        A final caveat is that some stats, even after this \\\"final\\\"\n        transformation, go through yet another set of transformations directly\n        in the game as a result of dynamic, stateful scripts that get run. BNet\n        has no access to these scripts, nor any way to know which scripts get\n        executed. As a result, the stats for an item that you see in-game -\n        particularly for stats that are often impacted by Perks, like Magazine\n        Size - can change dramatically from what we return on Bungie.Net. This\n        is a known issue with no fix coming down the pipeline. Take these stats\n        with a grain of salt.\\r\n\n        Stats actually go through four transformations, for those\n        interested:\\r\n\n        1) \\\"Sandbox\\\" stat, the \\\"most raw\\\" form. These are pretty\n        much useless without transformations applied, and thus are not currently\n        returned in the API. If you really want these, we can provide them.\n        Maybe someone could do something cool with it?\\r\n\n        2) \\\"Investment\\\" stat (the stat's value after\n        DestinyStatDefinition's interpolation tables and aggregation logic is\n        applied to the \\\"Sandbox\\\" stat value)\\r\n\n        3) \\\"Display\\\" stat (the stat's base UI-visible value after\n        DestinyStatGroupDefinition's interpolation tables are applied to the\n        Investment Stat value. For most stats, this is what is displayed.)\\r\n\n        4) Underlying in-game stat (the stat's actual value according to\n        the game, after the game runs dynamic scripts based on the game and\n        character's state. This is the final transformation that BNet does not\n        have access to.

Grab a cup of coffee before we begin, I can\n        wait.\\r\n\n        Talent Grids were the primary way that items could be customized\n        in Destiny 1. In Destiny 2, for now, talent grids have become\n        exclusively used by Subclass/Build items: but the system is still in\n        place for it to be used by items should the direction change back toward\n        talent grids.\\r\n\n        Talent Grids have Nodes: the visual circles on the talent grid\n        detail screen that have icons and can be activated if you meet certain\n        requirements and pay costs. The actual visual data and effects, however,\n        are driven by the \\\"Steps\\\" on Talent Nodes. Any given node will have\n        1:M of these steps, and the specific step that will be considered the\n        \\\"current\\\" step (and thus the dictator of all benefits, visual state,\n        and activation requirements on the Node) will almost always not be\n        determined until an instance of the item is created. This is how, in\n        Destiny 1, items were able to have such a wide variety of what users saw\n        as \\\"Perks\\\": they were actually Talent Grids with nodes that had a wide\n        variety of Steps, randomly chosen at the time of item creation.\\r\n\n        Now that Talent Grids are used exclusively by subclasses and\n        builds, all of the properties within still apply: but there are\n        additional visual elements on the Subclass/Build screens that are\n        superimposed on top of the talent nodes. Unfortunately, BNet doesn't\n        have this data: if you want to build a subclass screen, you will have to\n        provide your own \\\"decorative\\\" assets, such as the visual connectors\n        between nodes and the fancy colored-fire-bathed character standing\n        behind the nodes.\\r\n\n        DestinyInventoryItem.talentGrid.talentGridHash defines an item's\n        linked Talent Grid, which brings you to this definition that contains\n        enough satic data about talent grids to make your head spin. These\n        *must* be combined with instanced data - found when live data returns\n        DestinyItemTalentGridComponent - in order to derive meaning. The\n        instanced data will reference nodes and steps within these definitions,\n        which you will then have to look up in the definition and combine with\n        the instanced data to give the user the visual representation of their\n        item's talent grid.\"\n      properties:\n        exclusiveSets:\n          description: \"Talent Nodes can exist in \\\"exclusive sets\\\": these are sets of\n            nodes in which only a single node in the set can be activated at any\n            given time.

Vendors are the Dolly Levi of the Destiny universe.\\r\n\n        - Traditional Vendors as you see in game: people who you come up\n        to and who give you quests, rewards, or who you can buy things from.\\r\n\n        - Kiosks/Collections, which are really just Vendors that don't\n        charge currency (or charge some pittance of a currency) and whose gating\n        for purchases revolves more around your character's state.\\r\n\n        - Previews for rewards or the contents of sacks. These are\n        implemented as Vendors, where you can't actually purchase from them but\n        the items that they have for sale and the categories of sale items\n        reflect the rewards or contents of the sack. This is so that the game\n        could reuse the existing Vendor display UI for rewards and save a bunch\n        of wheel reinvention.\\r\n\n        - Item Transfer capabilities, like the Vault and Postmaster.\n        Vendors can have \\\"acceptedItem\\\" buckets that determine the source and\n        destination buckets for transfers. When you interact with such a vendor,\n        these buckets are what gets shown in the UI instead of any items that\n        the Vendor would have for sale. Yep, the Vault is a vendor.\\r\n\n        It is pretty much guaranteed that they'll be used for even more\n        features in the future.

Global = The gating on\n        this item is based entirely on global game state. It will be gated the\n        same for everyone. Clan = The gating on this item is at the Clan level.\n        For instance, if you're gated by Clan level this will be the case.\n        Profile = The gating includes Profile-specific checks, but not on the\n        Profile's characters. An example of this might be when you acquire an\n        Emblem: the Emblem will be available in your Kiosk for all characters in\n        your Profile from that point onward. Character = The gating includes\n        Character-specific checks, including character level restrictions. An\n        example of this might be an item that you can't purchase from a Vendor\n        until you reach a specific Character Level. Item = The gating includes\n        item-specific checks. For BNet, this generally implies that we'll show\n        this data only on a character level or deeper. AssumedWorstCase = The\n        unlocks and checks being used for this calculation are of an unknown\n        type and are used for unknown purposes. For instance, if some great\n        person decided that an unlock value should be globally scoped, but then\n        the game changes it using character-specific data in a way that BNet\n        doesn't know about. Because of the open-ended potential for this to\n        occur, many unlock checks for \\\"globally\\\" scoped unlock data may be\n        assumed as the worst case unless it has been specifically whitelisted as\n        otherwise.
