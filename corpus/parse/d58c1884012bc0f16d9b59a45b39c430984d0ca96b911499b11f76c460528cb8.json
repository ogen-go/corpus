This document is best used in conjunction with the <a\n    href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/welcome.html\">Amazon\n    Pinpoint Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>The Amazon Pinpoint Email API is\n    available in several AWS Regions and it provides an endpoint for each of\n    these Regions. For a list of all the Regions and endpoints where the API is\n    currently available, see <a\n    href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#pinpoint_region\">AWS\n    Regions and Endpoints</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General\n    Reference</i>.</p> <p>In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability\n    Zones. These Availability Zones are physically isolated from each other, but\n    are united by private, low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant\n    network connections. These Availability Zones enable us to provide very high\n    levels of availability and redundancy, while also minimizing latency. To\n    learn more about the number of Availability Zones that are available in each\n    Region, see <a\n    href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/\">AWS Global\n    Infrastructure</a>.</p>\n  x-logo:\n    url: https://twitter.com/awscloud/profile_image?size=original\n    backgroundColor: \"#FFFFFF\"\n  termsOfService: https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/\n  contact:\n    name: Mike Ralphson\n    email: mike.ralphson@gmail.com\n    url: https://github.com/mermade/aws2openapi\n    x-twitter: PermittedSoc\n  license:\n    name: Apache 2.0 License\n    url: http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n  x-providerName: amazonaws.com\n  x-serviceName: pinpoint-email\n  x-origin:\n    - contentType: application/json\n      url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/pinpoint-email-2018-07-26.normal.json\n      converter:\n        url: https://github.com/mermade/aws2openapi\n        version: 1.0.0\n      x-apisguru-direct: true\n  x-apiClientRegistration:\n    url: https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html?nc2=h_ct\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    - cloud\n  x-preferred: true\nexternalDocs:\n  description: Amazon Web Services documentation\n  url: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/email/\nx-hasEquivalentPaths: true\nsecurity:\n  - hmac: []\npaths:\n  /v1/email/configuration-sets:\n    post:\n      operationId: CreateConfigurationSet\n      description: \"Create a configuration set. <i>Configuration sets</i> are groups of\n        rules that you can apply to the emails you send using Amazon Pinpoint.\n        You apply a configuration set to an email by including a reference to\n        the configuration set in the headers of the email.
