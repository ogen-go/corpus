You can use the API to accept card\n    payments (including One-Click and 3D Secure), bank transfers, ewallets, and\n    many other payment methods.\n\n\n    To learn more about the API, visit [Classic integration](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/classic-integration).\n\n\n    ## Authentication\n\n    To connect to the Payments API, you must use your basic authentication credentials. For this, create your web service user, as described in [How to get the WS user password](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/user-management/how-to-get-the-web-service-ws-user-password). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:\n\n\n    ```\n\n    curl\n\n    -U \"ws@Company.YourCompany\":\"YourWsPassword\" \\\n\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n\n    ...\n\n    ```\n\n    Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n\n    ## Versioning\n\n    Payments API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\n\n    For example:\n\n    ```\n\n    https://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Payment/v30/authorise\n\n    ```\n  termsOfService: https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions\n  title: Adyen Payment Service\n  version: \"25\"\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    - payment\n  x-logo:\n    url: https://twitter.com/Adyen/profile_image?size=original\n  x-origin:\n    - converter:\n        url: https://github.com/lucybot/api-spec-converter\n        version: 2.7.31\n      format: openapi\n      url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adyen/adyen-openapi/master/specs/3.0/PaymentService-v25.json\n      version: \"3.0\"\n  x-preferred: false\n  x-providerName: adyen.com\n  x-serviceName: PaymentService\npaths:\n  /authorise:\n    post:\n      description: \u003e-\n        Creates a payment with a unique reference (`pspReference`) and attempts\n        to obtain an authorisation hold.
