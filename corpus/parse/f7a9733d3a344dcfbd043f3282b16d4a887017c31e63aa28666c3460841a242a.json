A Measurement represents any measured, calculated or non-measured non-calculated quantity. Any piece of equipment may contain Measurements, e.g. a substation may have temperature measurements and door open indications, a transformer may have oil temperature and tank pressure measurements, a bay may contain a number of power flow measurements and a Breaker may contain a switch status measurement.  The PSR - Measurement association is intended to capture this use of Measurement and is included in the naming hierarchy based on EquipmentContainer. The naming hierarchy typically has Measurements as leafs, e.g. Substation-VoltageLevel-Bay-Switch-Measurement. Some Measurements represent quantities related to a particular sensor location in the network, e.g. a voltage transformer (PT) at a busbar or a current transformer (CT) at the bar between a breaker and an isolator. The sensing position is not captured in the PSR - Measurement association. Instead it is captured by the Measurement - Terminal association that is used to define the sensing location in the network topology. The location is defined by the connection of the Terminal to ConductingEquipment.  If both a Terminal and PSR are associated, and the PSR is of type ConductingEquipment, the associated Terminal should belong to that ConductingEquipment instance. When the sensor location is needed both Measurement-PSR and Measurement-Terminal are used. The Measurement-Terminal association is never used alone.\n  title: Measurement\n  version: \"1.0.0\"\nopenapi: \"3.0.0\"\n\npaths: \n  /ngsi-ld/v1/entities: \n    get: \n      description: \"Retrieve a set of entities which matches a specific query from an NGSI-LD system\"\n      parameters: \n        - \n          in: query\n          name: type\n          required: true\n          schema: \n            enum: \n              - Measurement\n            type: string\n      responses: \n        ? \"200\"\n        : \n          content: \n            application/ld+json: \n              examples: \n                keyvalues: \n                  summary: \"Key-Values Pairs\"\n                  value: \n                    - \n                      $ref: \"https://smart-data-models.github.io/dataModel.EnergyCIM/Measurement/examples/example.json\"\n                normalized: \n                  summary: \"Normalized NGSI-LD\"\n                  value: \n                    - \n                      $ref: \"https://smart-data-models.github.io/dataModel.EnergyCIM/Measurement/examples/example-normalized.jsonld\"\n          description: OK\n      tags: \n        - ngsi-ld\ntags: \n  - \n    description: \"NGSI-LD Linked-data Format\"\n    name: ngsi-ld\n"
