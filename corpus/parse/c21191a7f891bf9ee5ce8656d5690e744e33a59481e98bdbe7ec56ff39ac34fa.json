If an item in a Promoted Listings campaign sells, the seller is assessed a Promoted Listings fee, which is a seller-specified percentage applied to the sales price. For complete details, see <a href=\\\"/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/promoted-listings.html\\\">Promoted Listings</a>.</li>  <li><b>Promotions Manager</b> gives sellers a way to offer discounts on specific items as a way to attract buyers to their inventory. Sellers can set up discounts (such as \\\"20% off\\\" and other types of offers) on specific items or on an entire customer order. To further attract buyers, eBay prominently displays promotion <i>teasers</i> throughout buyer flows. For complete details, see <a href=\\\"/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/promotions-manager.html\\\">Promotions Manager</a>.</li></ul>  <p><b>Marketing reports</b>, on both the Promoted Listings and Promotions Manager platforms, give sellers information that shows the effectiveness of their marketing strategies.

With markdown promotions, all the buyer needs to do is purchase the item to receive the promotion benefit.</p>  <p class=\\\"tablenote\\\"><b>Important:</b> There are some restrictions for which listings are available for price markdown promotions. For details, see <a href=\\\"/api-docs/sell/marketing/static/overview.html#PM-requirements\\\">Promotions Manager requirements and restrictions</a>. <br><br>In addition, we recommend you list items at competitive prices before including them in your markdown promotions. For an extensive list of pricing recommendations, see the <b>Growth</b> tab in Seller Hub.</p> <p>There are two ways to add items to markdown promotions:</p> <ul><li><b>Key-based promotions</b> select items using either the listing IDs or inventory reference IDs of the items you want to promote. Note that if you use inventory reference IDs, you must specify both the <b>inventoryReferenceId</b> and the associated <b>inventoryReferenceType</b> of the item(s) you want to include the promotion.</li>  <li><b>Rule-based promotions</b> select items using a list of eBay category IDs or seller Store category IDs. Rules can further constrain items in a promotion by minimum and maximum prices, brands, and item conditions.</li></ul>  <p>New promotions must be created in either a <code>DRAFT</code> or a <code>SCHEDULED</code> state. Use the DRAFT state when you are initially creating a promotion and you want to be sure it's correctly configured before scheduling it to run. When you create a promotion, the promotion ID is returned in the <b>Location</b> response header. Use this ID to reference the promotion in subsequent requests (such as to schedule a promotion that's in a DRAFT state).</p>  <p class=\\\"tablenote\\\"><b>Tip:</b> Refer to <a href=\\\"/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/promotions-manager.html\\\">Promotions Manager</a> in the <i>Selling Integration Guide</i> for details and examples showing how to create and manage seller promotions.</p>  <p>Markdown promotions are available on all eBay marketplaces.

The seller can specify the number of times a buyer can use the coupon and the maximum amount across all purchases that can be discounted using the coupon. The coupon code can also be made public (appearing on the seller’s Offer page, search pages, the item listing, and the checkout page) or private (only on the seller’s Offer page, but the seller can include the code in email and social media).</p> <p class=\\\"tablenote\\\"><b>Note</b>: Coded Coupons are currently available in the US, UK, DE, FR, IT, ES, and AU marketplaces.</p><p>There are two ways to add items to a threshold promotion:</p>  <ul><li><b>Key-based promotions</b> select items using either the listing IDs or inventory reference IDs of the items you want to promote. Note that if you use inventory reference IDs, you must specify both the <b>inventoryReferenceId</b> and the associated <b>inventoryReferenceType</b> of the item(s) you want to include the promotion.</li> <li><b>Rule-based promotions</b> select items using a list of eBay category IDs or seller Store category IDs. Rules can further constrain items in a promotion by minimum and maximum prices, brands, and item conditions.</li></ul>  <p>You must create a new promotion in either a <code>DRAFT</code> or <code>SCHEDULED</code> state. Use the DRAFT state when you are initially creating a promotion and you want to be sure it's correctly configured before scheduling it to run. When you create a promotion, the promotion ID is returned in the <b>Location</b> response header. Use this ID to reference the promotion in subsequent requests.</p>  <p class=\\\"tablenote\\\"><b>Tip:</b> Refer to the <a href=\\\"/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/promotions-manager.html\\\">Selling Integration Guide</a> for details and examples showing how to create and manage threshold promotions using the Promotions Manager.</p>  <p>For information on the eBay marketplaces that support item promotions, see <a href=\\\"/api-docs/sell/marketing/static/overview.html#PM-requirements\\\">Promotions Manager requirements and restrictions</a>.</p>\",\n        \"operationId\": \"createItemPromotion\",\n        \"requestBody\": {\n          \"description\": \"This type defines the fields that describe an item promotion.\",\n          \"content\": {\n            \"application/json\": {\n              \"schema\": {\n                \"description\": \"This type defines the fields that describe an item promotion.\",\n                \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/ItemPromotion\"\n              }\n            }\n          },\n          \"required\": false\n        },\n        \"responses\": {\n          \"201\": {\n            \"description\": \"Created\",\n            \"headers\": {\n              \"Location\": {\n                \"schema\": {\n                  \"type\": \"string\",\n                  \"description\": \"URL location of new item promotion.\"\n                }\n              }\n            },\n            \"content\": {\n              \"application/json\": {\n                \"schema\": {\n                  \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/BaseResponse\"\n                }\n              }\n            },\n            \"x-response-codes\": {\n              \"errors\": {\n                \"38226\": {\n                  \"domain\": \"API_MARKETING\",\n                  \"category\": \"REQUEST\",\n                  \"description\": \"The listing ID must be numeric if you're using listingIds.\"\n                },\n                \"38227\": {\n                  \"domain\": \"API_MARKETING\",\n                  \"category\": \"REQUEST\",\n                  \"description\": \"The listing ID is invalid.\"\n                },\n                \"38263\": {\n                  \"domain\": \"API_MARKETING\",\n                  \"category\": \"REQUEST\",\n                  \"description\": \"The SKU or custom label used in inventoryReferenceId exceeds the maximum length, which is {skuLength}.\"\n                },\n                \"38272\": {\n                  \"domain\": \"API_MARKETING\",\n                  \"category\": \"BUSINESS\",\n                  \"description\": \"This listing is not eligible for a promotion because it's an auction-style listing.\"\n                },\n                \"38273\": {\n                  \"domain\": \"API_MARKETING\",\n                  \"category\": \"BUSINESS\",\n                  \"description\": \"This listing is not eligible for a promotion because it's a minimum advertised price (MAP) listing.\"\n                },\n                \"38274\": {\n                  \"domain\": \"API_MARKETING\",\n                  \"category\": \"BUSINESS\",\n                  \"description\": \"You haven't included electronic payment method as a payment method.
