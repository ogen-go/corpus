This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor''s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn''t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:\u0026red green:\u0026green blue:\u0026blue alpha:\u0026alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha \u003c= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(''alpha'' in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join('',''); return [''rgba('', rgbParams, '','', alphaFrac, '')''].join(''''); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red \u003c\u003c 16) | (green \u003c\u003c 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [''#'']; for (var i = 0; i \u003c missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(''0''); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(''''); }; // ...'\n      id: Color\n      properties:\n        alpha:\n          description: 'The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).'\n          format: float\n          type: number\n        blue:\n          description: The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].\n          format: float\n          type: number\n        green:\n          description: The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].\n          format: float\n          type: number\n        red:\n          description: The amount of red in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].\n          format: float\n          type: number\n      type: object\n    ColorInfo:\n      description: Color information consists of RGB channels, score, and the fraction of the image that the color occupies in the image.\n      id: ColorInfo\n      properties:\n        color:\n          $ref: '#/components/schemas/Color'\n          description: RGB components of the color.\n        pixelFraction:\n          description: The fraction of pixels the color occupies in the image.

All other columns are optional. If the `ProductSet` or `Product` specified by the `product-set-id` and `product-id` values does not exist, then the system will create a new `ProductSet` or `Product` for the image. In this case, the `product-display-name` column refers to display_name, the `product-category` column refers to product_category, and the `labels` column refers to product_labels. The `image-id` column is optional but must be unique if provided. If it is empty, the system will automatically assign a unique id to the image. The `product-display-name` column is optional. If it is empty, the system sets the display_name field for the product to a space (\" \"). You can update the `display_name` later by using the API. If a `Product` with the specified `product-id` already exists, then the system ignores the `product-display-name`, `product-category`, and `labels` columns. The `labels` column (optional) is a line containing a list of comma-separated key-value pairs, in the following format: \"key_1=value_1,key_2=value_2,...,key_n=value_n\" The `bounding-poly` column (optional) identifies one region of interest from the image in the same manner as `CreateReferenceImage`. If you do not specify the `bounding-poly` column, then the system will try to detect regions of interest automatically. At most one `bounding-poly` column is allowed per line. If the image contains multiple regions of interest, add a line to the CSV file that includes the same product information, and the `bounding-poly` values for each region of interest. The `bounding-poly` column must contain an even number of comma-separated numbers, in the format \"p1_x,p1_y,p2_x,p2_y,...,pn_x,pn_y\". Use non-negative integers for absolute bounding polygons, and float values in [0, 1] for normalized bounding polygons.

On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.\n      operationId: vision.operations.cancel\n      parameters:\n        - in: path\n          name: operationsId:cancel\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/CancelOperationRequest'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Empty'\n          description: Successful response\n      security:\n        - Oauth2:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n          Oauth2c:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n        - Oauth2:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-vision\n          Oauth2c:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-vision\n      tags:\n        - operations\n  /v1/projects/{projectsId}/files:annotate:\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/alt'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/key'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/callback'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/uploadType'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/upload_protocol'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/_.xgafv'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/oauth_token'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/prettyPrint'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/access_token'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/quotaUser'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/fields'\n    post:\n      description: Service that performs image detection and annotation for a batch of files.

If a Product is a member of the specified ProductSet in addition to other ProductSets, the Product will still be deleted. It is recommended to not delete the specified ProductSet until after this operation has completed. It is also recommended to not add any of the Products involved in the batch delete to a new ProductSet while this operation is running because those Products may still end up deleted. It's not possible to undo the PurgeProducts operation. Therefore, it is recommended to keep the csv files used in ImportProductSets (if that was how you originally built the Product Set) before starting PurgeProducts, in case you need to re-import the data after deletion. If the plan is to purge all of the Products from a ProductSet and then re-use the empty ProductSet to re-import new Products into the empty ProductSet, you must wait until the PurgeProducts operation has finished for that ProductSet. The google.longrunning.Operation API can be used to keep track of the progress and results of the request. `Operation.metadata` contains `BatchOperationMetadata`.
