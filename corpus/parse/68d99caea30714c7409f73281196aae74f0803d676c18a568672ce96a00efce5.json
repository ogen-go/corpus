This method will set\n        the `DealServingMetadata.DealPauseStatus.has_buyer_paused` bit to false for\n        all deals in the proposal. Note that if the `has_seller_paused` bit is also\n        set, serving will not resume until the seller also resumes. It is a no-op\n        to resume an already-running proposal. It is an error to call ResumeProposal\n        for a proposal that is not finalized or renegotiating.\n      operationId: adexchangebuyer2.accounts.proposals.resume\n      parameters:\n      - description: Account ID of the buyer.\n        in: path\n        name: accountId\n        required: true\n        schema:\n          type: string\n      - description: The ID of the proposal to resume.\n        in: path\n        name: proposalId\n        required: true\n        schema:\n          type: string\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/ResumeProposalRequest'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Proposal'\n          description: Successful response\n      security:\n      - Oauth2:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adexchange.buyer\n        Oauth2c:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adexchange.buyer\n      tags:\n      - accounts\n  /v2beta1/accounts/{accountId}/publisherProfiles:\n    get:\n      description: List all publisher profiles visible to the buyer\n      operationId: adexchangebuyer2.accounts.publisherProfiles.list\n      parameters:\n      - description: Account ID of the buyer.\n        in: path\n        name: accountId\n        required: true\n        schema:\n          type: string\n      - description: Specify the number of results to include per page.\n        in: query\n        name: pageSize\n        schema:\n          type: integer\n      - description: The page token as return from ListPublisherProfilesResponse.\n        in: query\n        name: pageToken\n        schema:\n          type: string\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ListPublisherProfilesResponse'\n          description: Successful response\n      security:\n      - Oauth2:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adexchange.buyer\n        Oauth2c:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adexchange.buyer\n      tags:\n      - accounts\n    parameters:\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/_.xgafv'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/access_token'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/alt'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/callback'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/fields'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/key'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/oauth_token'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/prettyPrint'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/quotaUser'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/upload_protocol'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/uploadType'\n  /v2beta1/accounts/{accountId}/publisherProfiles/{publisherProfileId}:\n    get:\n      description: Gets the requested publisher profile by id.\n      operationId: adexchangebuyer2.accounts.publisherProfiles.get\n      parameters:\n      - description: Account ID of the buyer.\n        in: path\n        name: accountId\n        required: true\n        schema:\n          type: string\n      - description: The id for the publisher profile to get.\n        in: path\n        name: publisherProfileId\n        required: true\n        schema:\n          type: string\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/PublisherProfile'\n          description: Successful response\n      security:\n      - Oauth2:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adexchange.buyer\n        Oauth2c:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adexchange.buyer\n      tags:\n      - accounts\n    parameters:\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/_.xgafv'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/access_token'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/alt'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/callback'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/fields'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/key'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/oauth_token'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/prettyPrint'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/quotaUser'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/upload_protocol'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/uploadType'\n  /v2beta1/bidders/{biddersId}/accounts/{accountsId}/filterSets:\n    get:\n      description: Lists all filter sets for the account with the given account ID.\n      operationId: adexchangebuyer2.bidders.filterSets.list\n      parameters:\n      - description: Requested page size.
