The message has been delivered to the destination. No further deliveries will occur. |\n      | BUFFERED | The message is in buffered state. This is a general state used to describe a message as being active within the tyntec's platform. The message may be in retry or dispatched to a mobile network for delivery to the mobile. |\n      | EXPIRED | Message validity period has expired. The message has failed to be delivered within its validity period and/or retry period. No further delivery attempts will be made. |\n      | REJECTED | Message was rejected by the tyntec platform or destination network. Reasons for rejections can be insufficient funds, illegal content/senderId. More specific reasons are given on the `errorCode`. |\n      | UNDELIVERABLE | Message is undeliverable. The message has encountered a delivery error and is deemed permanently undeliverable. No further delivery attempts will be made. Certain network or platform internal errors result in the permanent non-delivery of a message. Examples of such errors would be an unknown subscriber or network error that indicated that the given destination mobile was denied SMS service or could not support SMS.
