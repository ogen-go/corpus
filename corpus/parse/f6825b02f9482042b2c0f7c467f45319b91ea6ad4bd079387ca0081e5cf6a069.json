The following are requirements\n            of `include_prefixes`: * Each include-prefix can contain any sequence\n            of Unicode characters, to a max length of 1024 bytes when UTF8-encoded,\n            and must not contain Carriage Return or Line Feed characters. Wildcard\n            matching and regular expression matching are not supported. * Each include-prefix\n            must omit the leading slash. For example, to include the object `s3://my-aws-bucket/logs/y=2015/requests.gz`,\n            specify the include-prefix as `logs/y=2015/requests.gz`. * None of the\n            include-prefix values can be empty, if specified. * Each include-prefix\n            must include a distinct portion of the object namespace. No include-prefix\n            may be a prefix of another include-prefix. The max size of `include_prefixes`\n            is 1000.

Use the transferOperations.get method to check\n        if the cancellation succeeded or if the operation completed despite the `cancel`\n        request. When you cancel an operation, the currently running transfer is interrupted.\n        For recurring transfer jobs, the next instance of the transfer job will still\n        run. For example, if your job is configured to run every day at 1pm and you\n        cancel Monday's operation at 1:05pm, Monday's transfer will stop. However,\n        a transfer job will still be attempted on Tuesday. This applies only to currently\n        running operations. If an operation is not currently running, `cancel` does\n        nothing. *Caution:* Canceling a transfer job can leave your data in an unknown\n        state. We recommend that you restore the state at both the destination and\n        the source after the `cancel` request completes so that your data is in a\n        consistent state. When you cancel a job, the next job computes a delta of\n        files and may repair any inconsistent state. For instance, if you run a job\n        every day, and today's job found 10 new files and transferred five files before\n        you canceled the job, tomorrow's transfer operation will compute a new delta\n        with the five files that were not copied today plus any new files discovered\n        tomorrow.\n      operationId: storagetransfer.transferOperations.cancel\n      parameters:\n      - in: path\n        name: transferOperationsId\n        required: true\n        schema:\n          type: string\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/CancelOperationRequest'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Empty'\n          description: Successful response\n      security:\n      - Oauth2:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n        Oauth2c:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n      tags:\n      - transferOperations\n  /v1/transferOperations/{transferOperationsId}:pause:\n    parameters:\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/_.xgafv'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/access_token'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/alt'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/callback'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/fields'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/key'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/oauth_token'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/prettyPrint'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/quotaUser'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/upload_protocol'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/uploadType'\n    post:\n      description: Pauses a transfer operation.\n      operationId: storagetransfer.transferOperations.pause\n      parameters:\n      - in: path\n        name: transferOperationsId\n        required: true\n        schema:\n          type: string\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/PauseTransferOperationRequest'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Empty'\n          description: Successful response\n      security:\n      - Oauth2:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n        Oauth2c:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n      tags:\n      - transferOperations\n  /v1/transferOperations/{transferOperationsId}:resume:\n    parameters:\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/_.xgafv'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/access_token'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/alt'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/callback'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/fields'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/key'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/oauth_token'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/prettyPrint'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/quotaUser'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/upload_protocol'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/uploadType'\n    post:\n      description: Resumes a transfer operation that is paused.\n      operationId: storagetransfer.transferOperations.resume\n      parameters:\n      - in: path\n        name: transferOperationsId\n        required: true\n        schema:\n          type: string\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/ResumeTransferOperationRequest'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Empty'\n          description: Successful response\n      security:\n      - Oauth2:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n        Oauth2c:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n      tags:\n      - transferOperations\n  /v1/{jobName}:\n    get:\n      description: Gets a transfer job.\n      operationId: storagetransfer.transferJobs.get\n      parameters:\n      - description: Required.

Use the transferOperations.get method to check\n        if the cancellation succeeded or if the operation completed despite the `cancel`\n        request. When you cancel an operation, the currently running transfer is interrupted.\n        For recurring transfer jobs, the next instance of the transfer job will still\n        run. For example, if your job is configured to run every day at 1pm and you\n        cancel Monday's operation at 1:05pm, Monday's transfer will stop. However,\n        a transfer job will still be attempted on Tuesday. This applies only to currently\n        running operations. If an operation is not currently running, `cancel` does\n        nothing. *Caution:* Canceling a transfer job can leave your data in an unknown\n        state. We recommend that you restore the state at both the destination and\n        the source after the `cancel` request completes so that your data is in a\n        consistent state. When you cancel a job, the next job computes a delta of\n        files and may repair any inconsistent state. For instance, if you run a job\n        every day, and today's job found 10 new files and transferred five files before\n        you canceled the job, tomorrow's transfer operation will compute a new delta\n        with the five files that were not copied today plus any new files discovered\n        tomorrow.\n      operationId: storagetransfer.transferOperations.cancel\n      parameters:\n      - description: The name of the operation resource to be cancelled.\n        in: path\n        name: name\n        required: true\n        schema:\n          type: string\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/CancelOperationRequest'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Empty'\n          description: Successful response\n      security:\n      - Oauth2:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n        Oauth2c:\n        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n      tags:\n      - transferOperations\n  /v1/{name}:pause:\n    parameters:\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/_.xgafv'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/access_token'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/alt'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/callback'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/fields'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/key'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/oauth_token'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/prettyPrint'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/quotaUser'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/upload_protocol'\n    - $ref: '#/components/parameters/uploadType'\n    post:\n      description: Pauses a transfer operation.\n      operationId: storagetransfer.transferOperations.pause\n      parameters:\n      - description: Required.
