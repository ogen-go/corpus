Batch computing is a common means for developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources. Batch uses the advantages of this computing workload to remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing required infrastructure. At the same time, it also adopts a familiar batch computing software approach. Given these advantages, Batch can help you to efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted, thus effectively helping you to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver your results more quickly.</p> <p>As a fully managed service, Batch can run batch computing workloads of any scale. Batch automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of your specific workloads. With Batch, there''s no need to install or manage batch computing software. This means that you can focus your time and energy on analyzing results and solving your specific problems. </p>'\n  x-logo:\n    url: 'https://twitter.com/awscloud/profile_image?size=original'\n    backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF'\n  termsOfService: 'https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/'\n  contact:\n    name: Mike Ralphson\n    email: mike.ralphson@gmail.com\n    url: 'https://github.com/mermade/aws2openapi'\n    x-twitter: PermittedSoc\n  license:\n    name: Apache 2.0 License\n    url: 'http://www.apache.org/licenses/'\n  x-providerName: amazonaws.com\n  x-serviceName: batch\n  x-origin:\n    - contentType: application/json\n      url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/batch-2016-08-10.normal.json'\n      converter:\n        url: 'https://github.com/mermade/aws2openapi'\n        version: 1.0.0\n      x-apisguru-driver: external\n  x-apiClientRegistration:\n    url: 'https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html?nc2=h_ct'\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    - cloud\n  x-preferred: true\nexternalDocs:\n  description: Amazon Web Services documentation\n  url: 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/'\nservers:\n  - url: 'http://batch.{region}.amazonaws.com'\n    variables:\n      region:\n        description: The AWS region\n        enum:\n          - us-east-1\n          - us-east-2\n          - us-west-1\n          - us-west-2\n          - us-gov-west-1\n          - us-gov-east-1\n          - ca-central-1\n          - eu-north-1\n          - eu-west-1\n          - eu-west-2\n          - eu-west-3\n          - eu-central-1\n          - eu-south-1\n          - af-south-1\n          - ap-northeast-1\n          - ap-northeast-2\n          - ap-northeast-3\n          - ap-southeast-1\n          - ap-southeast-2\n          - ap-east-1\n          - ap-south-1\n          - sa-east-1\n          - me-south-1\n        default: us-east-1\n    description: The AWS Batch multi-region endpoint\n  - url: 'https://batch.{region}.amazonaws.com'\n    variables:\n      region:\n        description: The AWS region\n        enum:\n          - us-east-1\n          - us-east-2\n          - us-west-1\n          - us-west-2\n          - us-gov-west-1\n          - us-gov-east-1\n          - ca-central-1\n          - eu-north-1\n          - eu-west-1\n          - eu-west-2\n          - eu-west-3\n          - eu-central-1\n          - eu-south-1\n          - af-south-1\n          - ap-northeast-1\n          - ap-northeast-2\n          - ap-northeast-3\n          - ap-southeast-1\n          - ap-southeast-2\n          - ap-east-1\n          - ap-south-1\n          - sa-east-1\n          - me-south-1\n        default: us-east-1\n    description: The AWS Batch multi-region endpoint\n  - url: 'http://batch.{region}.amazonaws.com.cn'\n    variables:\n      region:\n        description: The AWS region\n        enum:\n          - cn-north-1\n          - cn-northwest-1\n        default: cn-north-1\n    description: The AWS Batch endpoint for China (Beijing) and China (Ningxia)\n  - url: 'https://batch.{region}.amazonaws.com.cn'\n    variables:\n      region:\n        description: The AWS region\n        enum:\n          - cn-north-1\n          - cn-northwest-1\n        default: cn-north-1\n    description: The AWS Batch endpoint for China (Beijing) and China (Ningxia)\nx-hasEquivalentPaths: true\npaths:\n  /v1/canceljob:\n    post:\n      operationId: CancelJob\n      description: 'Cancels a job in an Batch job queue.

You can create <code>MANAGED</code> or <code>UNMANAGED</code> compute environments. <code>MANAGED</code> compute environments can use Amazon EC2 or Fargate resources. <code>UNMANAGED</code> compute environments can only use EC2 resources.</p> <p>In a managed compute environment, Batch manages the capacity and instance types of the compute resources within the environment. This is based on the compute resource specification that you define or the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html\">launch template</a> that you specify when you create the compute environment. Either, you can choose to use EC2 On-Demand Instances and EC2 Spot Instances. Or, you can use Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity in your managed compute environment. You can optionally set a maximum price so that Spot Instances only launch when the Spot Instance price is less than a specified percentage of the On-Demand price.</p> <note> <p>Multi-node parallel jobs aren''t supported on Spot Instances.</p> </note> <p>In an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your own EC2 compute resources and have a lot of flexibility with how you configure your compute resources. For example, you can use custom AMIs. However, you must verify that each of your AMIs meet the Amazon ECS container instance AMI specification. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container_instance_AMIs.html\">container instance AMIs</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>. After you created your unmanaged compute environment, you can use the <a>DescribeComputeEnvironments</a> operation to find the Amazon ECS cluster that''s associated with it. Then, launch your container instances into that Amazon ECS cluster. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_container_instance.html\">Launching an Amazon ECS container instance</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>Batch doesn''t upgrade the AMIs in a compute environment after the environment is created. For example, it doesn''t update the AMIs when a newer version of the Amazon ECS optimized AMI is available. Therefore, you''re responsible for managing the guest operating system (including its updates and security patches) and any additional application software or utilities that you install on the compute resources. To use a new AMI for your Batch jobs, complete these steps:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create a new compute environment with the new AMI.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the compute environment to an existing job queue.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove the earlier compute environment from your job queue.</p> </li> <li> <p>Delete the earlier compute environment.</p> </li> </ol> </note>'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Success\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/CreateComputeEnvironmentResponse'\n        '480':\n          description: ClientException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ClientException'\n        '481':\n          description: ServerException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ServerException'\n      parameters: []\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n              required:\n                - computeEnvironmentName\n                - type\n              properties:\n                computeEnvironmentName:\n                  description: 'The name for your compute environment.
