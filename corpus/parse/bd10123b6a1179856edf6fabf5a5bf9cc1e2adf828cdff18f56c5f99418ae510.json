DynamoDB lets you offload the administrative burdens\n    of operating and scaling a distributed database, so that you don't have to\n    worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication,\n    software patching, or cluster scaling.</p> <p>With DynamoDB, you can create\n    database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve\n    any level of request traffic. You can scale up or scale down your tables'\n    throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation, and use the\n    AWS Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance\n    metrics.</p> <p>DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your\n    tables over a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and\n    storage requirements, while maintaining consistent and fast performance. All\n    of your data is stored on solid state disks (SSDs) and automatically\n    replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an AWS region, providing\n    built-in high availability and data durability. </p>\n  x-logo:\n    url: https://twitter.com/awscloud/profile_image?size=original\n    backgroundColor: \"#FFFFFF\"\n  termsOfService: https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/\n  contact:\n    name: Mike Ralphson\n    email: mike.ralphson@gmail.com\n    url: https://github.com/mermade/aws2openapi\n    x-twitter: PermittedSoc\n  license:\n    name: Apache 2.0 License\n    url: http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n  x-providerName: amazonaws.com\n  x-serviceName: dynamodb\n  x-origin:\n    - contentType: application/json\n      url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/dynamodb-2012-08-10.normal.json\n      converter:\n        url: https://github.com/mermade/aws2openapi\n        version: 1.0.0\n      x-apisguru-direct: true\n  x-apiClientRegistration:\n    url: https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html?nc2=h_ct\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    - cloud\n  x-preferred: true\nexternalDocs:\n  description: Amazon Web Services documentation\n  url: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/\nx-hasEquivalentPaths: true\nsecurity:\n  - hmac: []\npaths:\n  /#X-Amz-Target=DynamoDB_20120810.BatchGetItem:\n    post:\n      operationId: BatchGetItem\n      description: <p>The <code>BatchGetItem</code> operation returns the attributes of one\n        or more items from one or more tables. You identify requested items by\n        primary key.</p> <p>A single operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data,\n        which can contain as many as 100 items. <code>BatchGetItem</code>\n        returns a partial result if the response size limit is exceeded, the\n        table's provisioned throughput is exceeded, or an internal processing\n        failure occurs. If a partial result is returned, the operation returns a\n        value for <code>UnprocessedKeys</code>. You can use this value to retry\n        the operation starting with the next item to get.</p> <important> <p>If\n        you request more than 100 items, <code>BatchGetItem</code> returns a\n        <code>ValidationException</code> with the message \"Too many items\n        requested for the BatchGetItem call.\"</p> </important> <p>For example,\n        if you ask to retrieve 100 items, but each individual item is 300 KB in\n        size, the system returns 52 items (so as not to exceed the 16 MB limit).\n        It also returns an appropriate <code>UnprocessedKeys</code> value so you\n        can get the next page of results. If desired, your application can\n        include its own logic to assemble the pages of results into one\n        dataset.</p> <p>If <i>none</i> of the items can be processed due to\n        insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request,\n        then <code>BatchGetItem</code> returns a\n        <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. If <i>at least\n        one</i> of the items is successfully processed, then\n        <code>BatchGetItem</code> completes successfully, while returning the\n        keys of the unread items in <code>UnprocessedKeys</code>.</p>\n        <important> <p>If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should\n        retry the batch operation on those items. However, <i>we strongly\n        recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm</i>. If you\n        retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write\n        requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If\n        you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual\n        requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed.</p> <p>For more\n        information, see <a\n        href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ErrorHandling.html#BatchOperations\">Batch\n        Operations and Error Handling</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer\n        Guide</i>.</p> </important> <p>By default, <code>BatchGetItem</code>\n        performs eventually consistent reads on every table in the request. If\n        you want strongly consistent reads instead, you can set\n        <code>ConsistentRead</code> to <code>true</code> for any or all\n        tables.</p> <p>In order to minimize response latency,\n        <code>BatchGetItem</code> retrieves items in parallel.</p> <p>When\n        designing your application, keep in mind that DynamoDB does not return\n        items in any particular order. To help parse the response by item,\n        include the primary key values for the items in your request in the\n        <code>ProjectionExpression</code> parameter.</p> <p>If a requested item\n        does not exist, it is not returned in the result. Requests for\n        nonexistent items consume the minimum read capacity units according to\n        the type of read.

In order to\n        improve performance with these large-scale operations,\n        <code>BatchWriteItem</code> does not behave in the same way as\n        individual <code>PutItem</code> and <code>DeleteItem</code> calls would.\n        For example, you cannot specify conditions on individual put and delete\n        requests, and <code>BatchWriteItem</code> does not return deleted items\n        in the response.</p> <p>If you use a programming language that supports\n        concurrency, you can use threads to write items in parallel. Your\n        application must include the necessary logic to manage the threads. With\n        languages that don't support threading, you must update or delete the\n        specified items one at a time. In both situations,\n        <code>BatchWriteItem</code> performs the specified put and delete\n        operations in parallel, giving you the power of the thread pool approach\n        without having to introduce complexity into your application.</p>\n        <p>Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and\n        delete request consumes the same number of write capacity units whether\n        it is processed in parallel or not. Delete operations on nonexistent\n        items consume one write capacity unit.</p> <p>If one or more of the\n        following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire batch write\n        operation:</p> <ul> <li> <p>One or more tables specified in the\n        <code>BatchWriteItem</code> request does not exist.</p> </li> <li>\n        <p>Primary key attributes specified on an item in the request do not\n        match those in the corresponding table's primary key schema.</p> </li>\n        <li> <p>You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in the\n        same <code>BatchWriteItem</code> request.

Also, there are per-table limits that apply\n        when you create a table there. For more information, see <a\n        href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Limits.html\">Limits</a>\n        page in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>Although you\n        can increase these limits by filing a case at <a\n        href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/\">AWS Support\n        Center</a>, obtaining the increase is not instantaneous. The\n        <code>DescribeLimits</code> action lets you write code to compare the\n        capacity you are currently using to those limits imposed by your account\n        so that you have enough time to apply for an increase before you hit a\n        limit.</p> <p>For example, you could use one of the AWS SDKs to do the\n        following:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Call <code>DescribeLimits</code> for a\n        particular Region to obtain your current account limits on provisioned\n        capacity there.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a variable to hold the\n        aggregate read capacity units provisioned for all your tables in that\n        Region, and one to hold the aggregate write capacity units. Zero them\n        both.</p> </li> <li> <p>Call <code>ListTables</code> to obtain a list of\n        all your DynamoDB tables.</p> </li> <li> <p>For each table name listed\n        by <code>ListTables</code>, do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Call\n        <code>DescribeTable</code> with the table name.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use\n        the data returned by <code>DescribeTable</code> to add the read capacity\n        units and write capacity units provisioned for the table itself to your\n        variables.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the table has one or more global\n        secondary indexes (GSIs), loop over these GSIs and add their provisioned\n        capacity values to your variables as well.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li>\n        <p>Report the account limits for that Region returned by\n        <code>DescribeLimits</code>, along with the total current provisioned\n        capacity levels you have calculated.</p> </li> </ol> <p>This will let\n        you see whether you are getting close to your account-level limits.</p>\n        <p>The per-table limits apply only when you are creating a new table.\n        They restrict the sum of the provisioned capacity of the new table\n        itself and all its global secondary indexes.</p> <p>For existing tables\n        and their GSIs, DynamoDB doesn't let you increase provisioned capacity\n        extremely rapidly. But the only upper limit that applies is that the\n        aggregate provisioned capacity over all your tables and GSIs cannot\n        exceed either of the per-account limits.</p> <note> <p>\n        <code>DescribeLimits</code> should only be called periodically.

You can query any table or secondary index that has a composite\n        primary key (a partition key and a sort key). </p> <p>Use the\n        <code>KeyConditionExpression</code> parameter to provide a specific\n        value for the partition key. The <code>Query</code> operation will\n        return all of the items from the table or index with that partition key\n        value. You can optionally narrow the scope of the <code>Query</code>\n        operation by specifying a sort key value and a comparison operator in\n        <code>KeyConditionExpression</code>. To further refine the\n        <code>Query</code> results, you can optionally provide a\n        <code>FilterExpression</code>. A <code>FilterExpression</code>\n        determines which items within the results should be returned to you. All\n        of the other results are discarded. </p> <p> A <code>Query</code>\n        operation always returns a result set. If no matching items are found,\n        the result set will be empty. Queries that do not return results consume\n        the minimum number of read capacity units for that type of read\n        operation. </p> <note> <p> DynamoDB calculates the number of read\n        capacity units consumed based on item size, not on the amount of data\n        that is returned to an application. The number of capacity units\n        consumed will be the same whether you request all of the attributes (the\n        default behavior) or just some of them (using a projection expression).\n        The number will also be the same whether or not you use a\n        <code>FilterExpression</code>. </p> </note> <p> <code>Query</code>\n        results are always sorted by the sort key value. If the data type of the\n        sort key is Number, the results are returned in numeric order;\n        otherwise, the results are returned in order of UTF-8 bytes. By default,\n        the sort order is ascending. To reverse the order, set the\n        <code>ScanIndexForward</code> parameter to false. </p> <p> A single\n        <code>Query</code> operation will read up to the maximum number of items\n        set (if using the <code>Limit</code> parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of\n        data and then apply any filtering to the results using\n        <code>FilterExpression</code>. If <code>LastEvaluatedKey</code> is\n        present in the response, you will need to paginate the result set. For\n        more information, see <a\n        href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Query.html#Query.Pagination\">Paginating\n        the Results</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>. </p> <p>\n        <code>FilterExpression</code> is applied after a <code>Query</code>\n        finishes, but before the results are returned.
