Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development. You must do this before you can go live (see ‘Onboarding’ below).\n\n    ## Related APIs\n    The following APIs also give access to the Electronic Prescription Service:\n    - [Electronic Prescription Service - HL7 V3 API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/electronic-prescription-service-hl7-v3) - use this if you want to use functions that are not yet available on the FHIR API\n    - [Signing Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/signing-service) - use this to digitally sign a prescription\n    - [Prescription Tracker API](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/eps-tracker) - use this if you want a read-only interface to obtain information about a patient’s prescriptions\n\n    The following APIs may be required when accessing the  Electronic Prescription Service:\n    - [Personal Demographics Service - FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-fhir) - use this to obtain patient data\n\n    ## API status and roadmap\n    The immediate priority of EPS development is to support the rollout of the next-gen FHIR APIs for primary care and secondary care prescribing and dispensing. Alongside this we will be working on integrating a new FHIR-compliant prescription tracker into the next gen APIs.\n    \n    ### Prescribing API\n    This API supports two types of prescribing medication workflows\n    \n    #### Primary care medication workflow\n    In a primary care medication workflow, the prescription is sent from a primary care service, such as a GP practice to a pharmacy. For this workflow, the API is in [beta](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status), meaning:\n    - it is available in integration and production\n    - we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give advance notice\n\n    #### Secondary care medication workflow\n    In a secondary care medication workflow, the prescription is sent from a secondary care service, such as an NHS hospital to a pharmacy. For this workflow, the API is in [beta](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status), meaning:\n    - it is available in integration and production\n    - we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give advance notice\n    \n    ### Dispensing API\n    This API supports two types of dispensing medication workflows\n\n    #### Community pharmacy workflow\n    In a community pharmacy workflow, prescriptions can be released (downloaded) from EPS, updated, dispensed, and then claimed by the pharmacy. For this workflow, the API is in [alpha](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status), meaning:\n    - it is available for testing in the integration environment, but not for production use\n    - we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give advance notice\n\n    #### Homecare dispenser workflow\n    In a homecare dispenser workflow, prescriptions can be released (downloaded) from EPS, updated, and dispensed by the dispenser. For this workflow, the API is in [alpha](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status), meaning:\n    - it is available for testing in the integration environment, but not for production use\n    - we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give advance notice\n\n    ### Roadmap\n    To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?tag=eps-fhir-api).\n    \n    If you have any other queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).\n\n    ## Service level\n    This API is a bronze service, meaning it is operational and supported only during business hours (8am to 6pm), Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays.\n\n    For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).\n\n    ## Technology\n    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).\n\n    It conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/), except that it does not support the [capabilities](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities) interaction.\n\n    It includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which are built against [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core).\n\n    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules. In particular:\n    - resource names are capitalised and singular, for example `/Patient` not `/patients`\n    - array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines\n    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object\n\n    ## Network access\n    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).\n    To use this API with [NHS smartcards](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers) you do need an HSCN connection, although internet-facing alternatives are available.\n\n    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).\n\n    ## Security and authorisation\n    ### User-restricted access\n    The EPS APIs are mostly [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis),\n    meaning we authenticate the end user.\n\n    EPS only supports [CIS2 combined authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-cis2-combined-authentication-and-authorisation),\n    do not use separate authentication and authorisation or try to authenticate using NHS Login.\n\n    The only interaction that is not user-restricted is bulk releasing nominated prescriptions.\n\n    ### Application-restricted access\n    You can use this access mode whilst bulk releasing nominated prescriptions whilst dispensing. To use this access mode, use the [Application-restricted RESTful API - signed JWT authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication) security pattern.\n\n    ## Environment and testing\n    | Environment       | Base URL                                                            |\n    | -------------     | --------------------------------------------------------------------|\n    | Sandbox           | `https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/electronic-prescriptions`       |\n    | Integration test  | `https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/electronic-prescriptions`           |\n    | Production        |  `https://api.service.nhs.uk/electronic-prescriptions`                                                 |\n\n    ### Sandbox testing\n    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):\n\n    * is for early developer testing\n    * only covers a limited set of scenarios\n    * is stateless, so it does not actually persist any updates\n    * is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation\n\n    For details of sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our \"Try this API\" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.\n\n    ### Integration testing\n    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):\n\n    * is for formal integration testing\n    * is stateful, so persists updates\n    * includes authorisation, with [smartcard](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers) and non-smartcard options\n\n    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).\n\n    ## Onboarding\n    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding.\n    We are hoping to make the onboarding process as lightweight and as self-service as possible. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.\n\n    To begin the onboarding process please download and complete the [EPS use case form](https://nhs-prod.global.ssl.fastly.net/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/developer/electronic-prescription-service-fhir-api/eps-access-form-v1.0-org-short-name-yyyymmdd-1.docx) and email it to us at [epsonboarding@nhs.net](mailto:epsonboarding@nhs.net).\n\n    ## Resources\n    Use the [Digital Medicines Implementation Guide](https://simplifier.net/guide/NHSDigital-Medicines) to assist with your integration.\n    This is the FHIR specification for Digital Medicines starting with the assets required for an electronic prescription sent to the EPS.\n    \n    For further guidance on prescribing, see [EPS prescribing developer guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/building-healthcare-software/prescriptions/eps-prescriber-developer-guide).\n\n    ## Errors\n    ### API wide errors\n    | HTTP Status   | Error Code             | Description                                                                      |\n    | --------------| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n    | 400           | MISSING_FIELD          | A required field is missing within the request, see `display` field in response. |\n    | 400           | INVALID_VALUE          | Invalid value in message.                                                        |\n    | 400           | INCORRECT_RESOURCETYPE | FHIR resource has an incorrect resourceType.                                     |\n    | 404           | NOT_FOUND              | Route not found.                                                                 |\n\n    ### Platform wide errors\n    | HTTP Status   | Error Code      | Description                                             |\n    | ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |\n    | 401           | ACCESS_DENIED   | User does not have permission for a particular request. |\n    | 403           | FORBIDDEN       | Insufficient authorization.                             |\n    | 404           | NOT_FOUND       | Resource not found.                                     |\n\n    For further details on common HTTP status codes, see [5xx status codes](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide)\n\nx-spec-publication:\n  operation-order:\n  - operations:\n    - method: POST\n      path: /FHIR/R4/$prepare\n    - method: POST\n      path: /FHIR/R4/$process-message#prescription-order\n    - method: POST\n      path: /FHIR/R4/Task/$release\n    - method: POST\n      path: /FHIR/R4/$verify-signature\n    - method: POST\n      path: /FHIR/R4/$process-message#dispense-notification\n    - method: POST\n      path: /FHIR/R4/Claim\n    - method: POST\n      path: /FHIR/R4/$process-message#prescription-order-update\n    - method: POST\n      path: /FHIR/R4/Task#return\n    - method: POST\n      path: /FHIR/R4/Task#withdraw\n    - method: GET\n      path: /FHIR/R4/Task\n\nservers:\n  - url: 'https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/electronic-prescriptions'\n    description: 'Sandbox'\n  - url: 'https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/electronic-prescriptions'\n    description: 'Integration test'\ntags:\n  - name: prescribing\n  - name: dispensing\n  - name: tracker\npaths:\n  /FHIR/R4/$prepare:\n    post:\n      operationId: prepare-prescription\n      summary: Encode prescription data\n      description: |\n        ## Overview\n        Use this endpoint to convert a FHIR [prescription-order message](https://simplifier.net/guide/NHSDigital-Medicines/Home/FHIRAssets/AllAssets/MessageDefinition-duplicate-2/prescription-order) into HL7 V3 signature fragments which can then be signed by the prescriber.\n      tags:\n        - prescribing\n      parameters:\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/BearerAuthorization'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/RoleId'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/RequestID'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/CorrelationID'\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/fhir+json:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n              description: The prescription order to be encoded for signing, expressed as a [prescription-order FHIR message bundle](https://simplifier.net/guide/NHSDigital-Medicines/Home/FHIRAssets/AllAssets/MessageDefinition-duplicate-2/prescription-order).\n            examples:\n              example:\n                description: |\n                  A valid secondary care prepare request.
