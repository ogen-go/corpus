A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit. </p> <p>When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code>. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error.</p> <p>To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status <code>PLACING</code>, where a new game session is created for the match. </p> <p>If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where one or more players rejected the match, the ticket status is returned to <code>SEARCHING</code> to find a new match. For tickets where one or more players failed to respond, the ticket status is set to <code>CANCELLED</code>, and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted as needed. </p> <p> <b>Learn more</b> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-client.html\"> Add FlexMatch to a game client</a> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-events.html\"> FlexMatch events</a> (reference)</p> <p> <b>Related actions</b> </p> <p> <a>StartMatchmaking</a> | <a>DescribeMatchmaking</a> | <a>StopMatchmaking</a> | <a>AcceptMatch</a> | <a>StartMatchBackfill</a> | <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/reference-awssdk.html#reference-awssdk-resources-fleets\">All APIs by task</a> </p>'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Success\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/AcceptMatchOutput'\n        '480':\n          description: InvalidRequestException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/InvalidRequestException'\n        '481':\n          description: NotFoundException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/NotFoundException'\n        '482':\n          description: InternalServiceException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/InternalServiceException'\n        '483':\n          description: UnsupportedRegionException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/UnsupportedRegionException'\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/AcceptMatchInput'\n      parameters:\n        - name: X-Amz-Target\n          in: header\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n            enum:\n              - GameLift.AcceptMatch\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Content-Sha256'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Date'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Algorithm'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Credential'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Security-Token'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Signature'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-SignedHeaders'\n  /#X-Amz-Target=GameLift.ClaimGameServer:\n    post:\n      operationId: ClaimGameServer\n      description: '<p> <b>This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.</b> </p> <p>Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves it to host gameplay and players.

In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for a fleet that is useful when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to another, such as when updating your game build. </p> <p>Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site. </p> <p>To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID and an ARN.

Several properties that are set when creating a game server group, including maximum/minimum size and auto-scaling policy settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling group. Keep in mind that some Auto Scaling group properties are periodically updated by GameLift FleetIQ as part of its balancing activities to optimize for availability and cost.</p> <p> <b>Learn more</b> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-intro.html\">GameLift FleetIQ Guide</a> </p> <p> <b>Related actions</b> </p> <p> <a>CreateGameServerGroup</a> | <a>ListGameServerGroups</a> | <a>DescribeGameServerGroup</a> | <a>UpdateGameServerGroup</a> | <a>DeleteGameServerGroup</a> | <a>ResumeGameServerGroup</a> | <a>SuspendGameServerGroup</a> | <a>DescribeGameServerInstances</a> | <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/reference-awssdk-fleetiq.html\">All APIs by task</a> </p>'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Success\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/CreateGameServerGroupOutput'\n        '480':\n          description: InvalidRequestException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/InvalidRequestException'\n        '481':\n          description: ConflictException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ConflictException'\n        '482':\n          description: UnauthorizedException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/UnauthorizedException'\n        '483':\n          description: InternalServiceException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/InternalServiceException'\n        '484':\n          description: LimitExceededException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/LimitExceededException'\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/CreateGameServerGroupInput'\n      parameters:\n        - name: X-Amz-Target\n          in: header\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n            enum:\n              - GameLift.CreateGameServerGroup\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Content-Sha256'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Date'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Algorithm'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Credential'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Security-Token'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Signature'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-SignedHeaders'\n  /#X-Amz-Target=GameLift.CreateGameSession:\n    post:\n      operationId: CreateGameSession\n      description: '<p>Creates a multiplayer game session for players in a specific fleet location.

The game server group status is changed to <code>DELETE_SCHEDULED</code>, which prevents new game servers from being registered and stops automatic scaling activity. Once all game servers in the game server group are deregistered, GameLift FleetIQ can begin deleting resources.

The information returned includes the maximum number of instances allowed and your account''s current usage across all fleets. This information can affect your ability to scale your GameLift fleets.

Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet''s hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet''s capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. </p> <p>Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences.</p> <p>You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling <a>StopFleetActions</a> with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call <a>StartFleetActions</a> with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove it, you must delete the policy with <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a>.</p> <p>Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html\">Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling</a>.</p> <p> <b>Target-based policy</b> </p> <p>A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet''s hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet''s buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target. </p> <p>For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet''s available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer. </p> <p>To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to \"TargetBased\". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a <a>TargetConfiguration</a> object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it''s successfully created. If the fleet''s auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.</p> <p> <b>Rule-based policy</b> </p> <p>A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action. </p> <p>For example, a policy may make the following statement: \"If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%.\"</p> <p>A policy''s rule statement has the following structure:</p> <p>If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code> <code>[Threshold]</code> for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code> to/by <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.</p> <p>To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:</p> <p>If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code> <code>[20]</code> for <code>[15]</code> minutes, then <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>.</p> <p>To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to \"RuleBased\". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they''re successfully created. If the fleet''s auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.</p> <p> <b>Related actions</b> </p> <p> <a>DescribeFleetCapacity</a> | <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a> | <a>DescribeEC2InstanceLimits</a> | <a>PutScalingPolicy</a> | <a>DescribeScalingPolicies</a> | <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a> | <a>StopFleetActions</a> | <a>StartFleetActions</a> | <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/reference-awssdk.html#reference-awssdk-resources-fleets\">All APIs by task</a> </p>'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Success\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/PutScalingPolicyOutput'\n        '480':\n          description: InternalServiceException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/InternalServiceException'\n        '481':\n          description: InvalidRequestException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/InvalidRequestException'\n        '482':\n          description: UnauthorizedException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/UnauthorizedException'\n        '483':\n          description: NotFoundException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/NotFoundException'\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/PutScalingPolicyInput'\n      parameters:\n        - name: X-Amz-Target\n          in: header\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n            enum:\n              - GameLift.PutScalingPolicy\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Content-Sha256'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Date'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Algorithm'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Credential'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Security-Token'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Signature'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-SignedHeaders'\n  /#X-Amz-Target=GameLift.RegisterGameServer:\n    post:\n      operationId: RegisterGameServer\n      description: '<p> <b>This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.</b> </p> <p>Creates a new game server resource and notifies GameLift FleetIQ that the game server is ready to host gameplay and players.

FlexMatch uses this information to select new players so that backfilled match continues to meet the original match requirements. </p> <p>When using FlexMatch with GameLift managed hosting, you can request a backfill match from a client service by calling this operation with a <a>GameSession</a> identifier. You also have the option of making backfill requests directly from your game server. In response to a request, FlexMatch creates player sessions for the new players, updates the <code>GameSession</code> resource, and sends updated matchmaking data to the game server. You can request a backfill match at any point after a game session is started. Each game session can have only one active backfill request at a time; a subsequent request automatically replaces the earlier request.</p> <p>When using FlexMatch as a standalone component, request a backfill match by calling this operation without a game session identifier. As with newly formed matches, matchmaking results are returned in a matchmaking event so that your game can update the game session that is being backfilled.</p> <p>To request a backfill match, specify a unique ticket ID, the original matchmaking configuration, and matchmaking data for all current players in the game session being backfilled. Optionally, specify the <code>GameSession</code> ARN. If successful, a match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. Track the status of backfill tickets using the same method for tracking tickets for new matches.</p> <p> <b>Learn more</b> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-backfill.html\"> Backfill existing games with FlexMatch</a> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-events.html\"> Matchmaking events</a> (reference)</p> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/gamelift-match.html\"> How GameLift FlexMatch works</a> </p> <p> <b>Related actions</b> </p> <p> <a>StartMatchmaking</a> | <a>DescribeMatchmaking</a> | <a>StopMatchmaking</a> | <a>AcceptMatch</a> | <a>StartMatchBackfill</a> | <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/reference-awssdk.html#reference-awssdk-resources-fleets\">All APIs by task</a> </p>'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Success\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/StartMatchBackfillOutput'\n        '480':\n          description: InvalidRequestException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/InvalidRequestException'\n        '481':\n          description: NotFoundException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/NotFoundException'\n        '482':\n          description: InternalServiceException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/InternalServiceException'\n        '483':\n          description: UnsupportedRegionException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/UnsupportedRegionException'\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/StartMatchBackfillInput'\n      parameters:\n        - name: X-Amz-Target\n          in: header\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n            enum:\n              - GameLift.StartMatchBackfill\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Content-Sha256'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Date'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Algorithm'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Credential'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Security-Token'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Signature'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-SignedHeaders'\n  /#X-Amz-Target=GameLift.StartMatchmaking:\n    post:\n      operationId: StartMatchmaking\n      description: '<p>Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking rules.

Before changing a fleet''s desired capacity, you may want to call <a>DescribeEC2InstanceLimits</a> to get the maximum capacity of the fleet''s EC2 instance type. Alternatively, consider using automatic scaling to adjust capacity based on player demand.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This operation can be used in the following ways: </p> <ul> <li> <p>To update capacity for a fleet''s home Region, or if the fleet has no remote locations, omit the <code>Location</code> parameter.

In response a change in desired capacity, GameLift initiates steps to start new instances or terminate existing instances in the requested fleet location. This continues until the location''s active instance count matches the new desired instance count. You can track a fleet''s current capacity by calling <a>DescribeFleetCapacity</a> or <a>DescribeFleetLocationCapacity</a>. If the requested desired instance count is higher than the instance type''s limit, the <code>LimitExceeded</code> exception occurs.</p> <p> <b>Learn more</b> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-manage-capacity.html\">Scaling fleet capacity</a> </p> <p> <b>Related actions</b> </p> <p> <a>CreateFleetLocations</a> | <a>UpdateFleetAttributes</a> | <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a> | <a>UpdateFleetPortSettings</a> | <a>UpdateRuntimeConfiguration</a> | <a>StopFleetActions</a> | <a>StartFleetActions</a> | <a>PutScalingPolicy</a> | <a>DeleteFleet</a> | <a>DeleteFleetLocations</a> | <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a> | <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/reference-awssdk.html#reference-awssdk-resources-fleets\">All APIs by task</a> </p>'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Success\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/UpdateFleetCapacityOutput'\n        '480':\n          description: NotFoundException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/NotFoundException'\n        '481':\n          description: ConflictException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ConflictException'\n        '482':\n          description: LimitExceededException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/LimitExceededException'\n        '483':\n          description: InvalidFleetStatusException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/InvalidFleetStatusException'\n        '484':\n          description: InternalServiceException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/InternalServiceException'\n        '485':\n          description: InvalidRequestException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/InvalidRequestException'\n        '486':\n          description: UnauthorizedException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/UnauthorizedException'\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/UpdateFleetCapacityInput'\n      parameters:\n        - name: X-Amz-Target\n          in: header\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n            enum:\n              - GameLift.UpdateFleetCapacity\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Content-Sha256'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Date'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Algorithm'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Credential'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Security-Token'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Signature'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-SignedHeaders'\n  /#X-Amz-Target=GameLift.UpdateFleetPortSettings:\n    post:\n      operationId: UpdateFleetPortSettings\n      description: '<p>Updates permissions that allow inbound traffic to connect to game sessions that are being hosted on instances in the fleet. </p> <p>To update settings, specify the fleet ID to be updated and specify the changes to be made.

For example, a rule set might describe a 4x4 match that requires all eight slots to be filled. </p> </li> <li> <p>Player attributes -- Optional. These attributes specify a set of player characteristics to evaluate when looking for a match. Matchmaking requests that use a rule set with player attributes must provide the corresponding attribute values. For example, an attribute might specify a player''s skill or level.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rules -- Optional. Rules define how to evaluate potential players for a match based on player attributes. A rule might specify minimum requirements for individual players, teams, or entire matches. For example, a rule might require each player to meet a certain skill level, each team to have at least one player in a certain role, or the match to have a minimum average skill level. or may describe an entire group--such as all teams must be evenly matched or have at least one player in a certain role. </p> </li> <li> <p>Expansions -- Optional. Expansions allow you to relax the rules after a period of time when no acceptable matches are found. This feature lets you balance getting players into games in a reasonable amount of time instead of making them wait indefinitely for the best possible match. For example, you might use an expansion to increase the maximum skill variance between players after 30 seconds.</p> </li> </ul>'\n    PlayerData:\n      type: string\n      minLength: 1\n      maxLength: 2048\n    PlayerSession:\n      type: object\n      properties:\n        PlayerSessionId:\n          allOf:\n            - $ref: '#/components/schemas/PlayerSessionId'\n            - description: A unique identifier for a player session.\n        PlayerId:\n          allOf:\n            - $ref: '#/components/schemas/NonZeroAndMaxString'\n            - description: A unique identifier for a player that is associated with this player session.\n        GameSessionId:\n          allOf:\n            - $ref: '#/components/schemas/NonZeroAndMaxString'\n            - description: A unique identifier for the game session that the player session is connected to.\n        FleetId:\n          allOf:\n            - $ref: '#/components/schemas/FleetId'\n            - description: A unique identifier for the fleet that the player's game session is running on.\n        FleetArn:\n          allOf:\n            - $ref: '#/components/schemas/FleetArn'\n            - description: ' The Amazon Resource Name (<a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html\">ARN</a>) associated with the GameLift fleet that the player''s game session is running on.
