You can use the API to manage your support cases programmatically. The AWS Support API uses HTTP methods that return results in JSON format.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p>You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support API. </p> </li> <li> <p>If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/\">AWS Support</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </note> <p>The AWS Support service also exposes a set of <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/\">AWS Trusted Advisor</a> features. You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check results, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of checks.</p> <p>The following list describes the AWS Support case management operations:</p> <ul> <li> <p> Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels - The <a>DescribeServices</a> and <a>DescribeSeverityLevels</a> operations return AWS service names, service codes, service categories, and problem severity levels.
