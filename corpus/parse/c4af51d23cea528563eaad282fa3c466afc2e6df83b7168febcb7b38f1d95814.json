ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information\n    for over 1 million regulated facilities nationwide.\n     CWA Rest Services provides multiple service endpoints, each with specific capabilities, to search and retrieve data on facilities regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and managed under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program. The returned results reflect data drawn from EPA's ICIS-NPDES database.\n\n     \n    The get_facilities, get_map, get_qid, and get_download end points are meant to be used together, while the enhanced get_facility_info end point is self contained.\n      The get_facility_info end point returns either an array of state, county or zip clusters with summary statistics per cluster or an array of facilities.\n\n     \n    The recommended use scenario for get_facilities, get_qid, get_map, and get_downoad is:\n     \n     \u003cb\u003e1)\u003c/b\u003e  Use get_facilities to validate passed query parameters, obtain summary statistics and to obtain a query_id (QID).  QIDs are time sensitive and will be valid for approximately 30 minutes.\n     \u003cb\u003e2)\u003c/b\u003e  Use get_qid, with the returned QID, to paginate through arrays of facility results.\n     \u003cb\u003e3)\u003c/b\u003e  Use get_map, with the returned QID, to zoom in/out and pan on the clustered and individual facility coordinates that meet the QID query criteria.\n     \u003cb\u003e4)\u003c/b\u003e  Use get_download, with the returned QID, to generate a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file of facility information that meets the QID query criteria.\n\n     \n\n     \n    Use the qcolumns parameter to customize your search results.  Use the Metdata service endpoint for a list of available output objects, their Column Ids, and their definitions to help you build your customized output. \n     \n    Additional ECHO Resources:   \u003ca href=\"https://echo.epa.gov/tools/web-services\"\u003eWeb Services\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://echo.epa.gov/resources/echo-data/about-the-data\"\u003eAbout ECHO's Data\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads\"\u003eData Downloads\u003c/a\u003e\n  license:\n    name: This page was built with the Swagger API.\n    url: https://swagger.io\n  title: U.S. EPA Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) - Clean Water Act\n    (CWA) Rest Services\n  version: 0.0.0\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    - open_data\n  x-logo:\n    backgroundColor: \"#FFFFFF\"\n    url: https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/632233890594299904/DgRDU6dx_400x400.png\n  x-origin:\n    - format: swagger\n      url: https://ofmpub.epa.gov/echo/swaggerx.swagger_json?p_prefix=CWA\n      version: \"2.0\"\n  x-providerName: epa.gov\n  x-serviceName: cwa\npaths:\n  /cwa_rest_services.get_download:\n    get:\n      description: Based on the QID obtained from a get_facilities or get_facility_info\n        query, return a comma separated value (CSV) file of the facilities\n        found.\n      parameters:\n        - description: \u003e-\n            Output Format Flag.
