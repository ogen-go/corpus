Some examples are:\n\n\n        * The institution's policy has changed, making more transactions\n        available\n\n        * Finicity has now added a longer transaction history support for the\n        institution\n\n        * The first call encountered an error, and the resulting Aggregation\n        Ticket has now been fixed by the Finicity Support Team\n\n\n        In these cases, the POST request can contain the parameter `force=true`\n        in the request body to force the second connection.\n\n\n        _Supported regions_: ![üá∫üá∏](https://flagcdn.com/20x15/us.png)\n      operationId: LoadHistoricTransactionsForCustomerAccount\n      parameters:\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/CustomerIdParameter'\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/AccountIdParameter'\n      requestBody:\n        $ref: '#/components/requestBodies/LoadHistoricTransactionsForCustomerAccountRequest'\n      responses:\n        '203':\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/MFAChallengeNeededResponse'\n        '204':\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/LoadHistoricTransactionsForCustomerAccountResponse'\n        '400':\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/BadRequestErrorResponse'\n        '401':\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/UnauthorizedErrorResponse'\n        '404':\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/ResourceNotFoundErrorResponse'\n  '/aggregation/v1/customers/{customerId}/accounts/{accountId}/owner':\n    get:\n      tags:\n        - Accounts\n      summary: Get Account Owner\n      description: \u003e-\n        Retrieve the names and addresses of the account owner from a financial\n        institution.\n\n\n        Note: this is a premium service, billable per every successful API call.\n\n\n        This service retrieves account data from the institution.
