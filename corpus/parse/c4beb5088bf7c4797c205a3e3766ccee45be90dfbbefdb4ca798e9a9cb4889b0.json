The template defines a collection of resources as a single\n    unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates and deletes all member\n    resources of the stack together and manages all dependencies between the\n    resources for you.</p> <p>For more information about AWS CloudFormation, see\n    the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/\">AWS CloudFormation\n    Product Page</a>.</p> <p>Amazon CloudFormation makes use of other AWS\n    products.

Macros perform custom processing on templates; this\n            can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the\n            way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of\n            this, users typically create a change set from the processed\n            template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the\n            macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template\n            contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack\n            directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the\n            resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this\n            capability.

If your stack\n                    template contains one or more macros, and you choose to\n                    create a stack directly from the processed template, without\n                    first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you\n                    must acknowledge this capability.

For example, if you\n                    create a stack using the console, each stack event would be\n                    assigned the same token in the following format:\n                    <code>Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987\\\n                    002</code>. </p>\"\n                  type: string\n                  minLength: 1\n                  maxLength: 128\n                  pattern: \"[a-zA-Z0-9][-a-zA-Z0-9]*\"\n              required:\n                - StackName\n  /#Action=DeleteStackInstances:\n    get:\n      x-aws-operation-name: DeleteStackInstances\n      operationId: GET DeleteStackInstances\n      description: \"Deletes stack instances for the specified accounts, in the specified\n        regions. \"\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: Success\n          content:\n            text/xml:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/DeleteStackInstancesOutput\"\n        \"480\":\n          description: StackSetNotFoundException\n          content:\n            text/xml:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/StackSetNotFoundException\"\n        \"481\":\n          description: OperationInProgressException\n          content:\n            text/xml:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/OperationInProgressException\"\n        \"482\":\n          description: OperationIdAlreadyExistsException\n          content:\n            text/xml:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/OperationIdAlreadyExistsException\"\n        \"483\":\n          description: StaleRequestException\n          content:\n            text/xml:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/StaleRequestException\"\n        \"484\":\n          description: InvalidOperationException\n          content:\n            text/xml:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/InvalidOperationException\"\n      parameters:\n        - name: StackSetName\n          in: query\n          required: true\n          description: The name or unique ID of the stack set that you want to delete stack\n            instances for.\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - name: Accounts\n          in: query\n          required: true\n          description: The names of the AWS accounts that you want to delete stack\n            instances for.\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              type: string\n        - name: Regions\n          in: query\n          required: true\n          description: \"The regions where you want to delete stack set instances. \"\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              type: string\n        - name: OperationPreferences.RegionOrder\n          in: query\n          description: >-\n            <p>The user-specified preferences for how AWS CloudFormation\n            performs a stack set operation. </p> <p>For more information on\n            maximum concurrent accounts and failure tolerance, see <a\n            href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-concepts.html#stackset-ops-options\">Stack\n            set operation options</a>.</p>\n\n            The order of the regions in where you want to perform the stack operation.\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              type: string\n        - name: OperationPreferences.FailureToleranceCount\n          in: query\n          description: >-\n            <p>The user-specified preferences for how AWS CloudFormation\n            performs a stack set operation. </p> <p>For more information on\n            maximum concurrent accounts and failure tolerance, see <a\n            href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-concepts.html#stackset-ops-options\">Stack\n            set operation options</a>.</p>\n\n            <p>The number of accounts, per region, for which this operation can fail before AWS CloudFormation stops the operation in that region.

The SignalResource\n        API is useful in cases where you want to send signals from anywhere\n        other than an Amazon EC2 instance.\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: Success\n      parameters:\n        - name: Action\n          in: query\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n            enum:\n              - SignalResource\n        - name: Version\n          in: query\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n            enum:\n              - 2010-05-15\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/x-www-form-urlencoded:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n              properties:\n                StackName:\n                  description: The stack name or unique stack ID that includes the resource\n                    that you want to signal.\n                  type: string\n                  minLength: 1\n                  pattern: ([a-zA-Z][-a-zA-Z0-9]*)|(arn:\\b(aws|aws-us-gov|aws-cn)\\b:[-a-zA-Z0-9:/._+]*)\n                LogicalResourceId:\n                  description: The logical ID of the resource that you want to signal.

If you send\n                    multiple signals to a single resource (such as signaling a\n                    wait condition), each signal requires a different unique ID.\n                  type: string\n                  minLength: 1\n                  maxLength: 64\n                Status:\n                  description: The status of the signal, which is either success or\n                    failure.

Macros perform custom processing on templates; this\n            can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the\n            way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of\n            this, users typically create a change set from the processed\n            template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the\n            macros before actually updating the stack. If your stack template\n            contains one or more macros, and you choose to update a stack\n            directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the\n            resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this\n            capability.

Macros perform custom processing on\n                    templates; this can include simple actions like\n                    find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive\n                    transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users\n                    typically create a change set from the processed template,\n                    so that they can review the changes resulting from the\n                    macros before actually updating the stack. If your stack\n                    template contains one or more macros, and you choose to\n                    update a stack directly from the processed template, without\n                    first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you\n                    must acknowledge this capability.
