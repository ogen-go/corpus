These values are the recommended keys which should be used in the current version and will be the only accepted in the next MAJOR release: *headerMissing*: An expected header is missing at the request. Ex: `talq-api-version` header missing.; *headerValueNotValid*: A received header has a not valid value. Ex: `talq-api-version` header value (2.1.0) is not the expected (2.2.0).; *parameterMissing*: An expected parameter is missing at the request. Ex: `clientAddress` is missing.; *parameterValueNotValid*: The received parameter has a not valid value. Ex: The `clientAddress` is not valid.; *payloadError*: The payload has some error as it is not as defined in the TALQ Specification.  Ex: The device payload without `deviceAddress` is not as defined by the OAS DM file (`deviceAddress` is a required attribute).; *resourceNotFound*: The referred resource by the request is not found.; *resourceConflict*: The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource. Ex: A PUT request over a device with a function not included in its device class is erroneously sent.; *relatedResourceNotFound*: A resource related to an entity's attribute is not found. Ex: A `LampActuatorFunction.calendarID` is sent for a missing Calendar.; *deletingResourceIsReferred*: This error happens when a DELETE request tries to delete a resource that is referred by other entity. Ex: A DELETE request for a given calendar fails because this calendar is used by some LampActuators.; *serviceConstraintExceeded*: The service constraint has been surpassed. Ex: More calendars than the allowed by the `'maximumCalendars'` ControlService constraint has been created by the request.; *assignmentEntityNotValid*: The entity assigned to the referred resource is not valid. Ex: An assign command tries to assign a LampType, with `DALI` control type, to a given LampActuator, but the actual hardware is `1-10V` controlled.; *assignmentAddressNotValid*: The referred resource does not have any function appropriate to the assigned entity. Ex: An assign command tries to assign a calendar to a device without actuator functions.; *overrideCommandNotValid*: The command sent to the referred resource is not valid. Ex: An override command sends a command with a level state impossible to apply to the referred actuator function (level=77% when the actual lamp does not have this precision).; *overrideAddressNotValid*: The referred resource does not have any function appropriate to the override command.

We might also want to let the configuration to the vendor itself and simply define events notifying the CMS that the default configuration has changed. For example, a garbage bin could have its location defined based on a sensor placed on the floor. If the bin is not above this sensor, the vendor will trigger an event.
