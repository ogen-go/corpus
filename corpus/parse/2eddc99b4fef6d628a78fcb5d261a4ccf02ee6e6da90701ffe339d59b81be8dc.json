Associations can be made at many\n        levels of granularity (from whole genotypes down to individual\n        SNVs), but users may use these methods with partial or\n        inexact information.  Therefore, the query methods must be\n        able to support query of some or all of the associated features.\n        Furthermore, use of the relationships between genomic features\n        means that when querying for a gene, any variants to that\n        gene are also returned.  For example, a query with\n        BRCA2 would mean that in addition to any direct associations\n        to the BRCA2, all associations to sequence variants of BRCA2 would also\n        be returned.  Similarly, queries with OntologyTerms should perform\n        the subclass closure.\n\n        Each query can be made against a string, an array of external\n        identifers (such as for gene or SNP ids), ontology term ids, or\n        full feature/phenotype/evidence objects.\n      properties:\n        evidence:\n          items:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/EvidenceQuery'\n          title: evidence\n          type: array\n        feature_ids:\n          description: At least one feature_id or phenotype_id must be provided.\n          items:\n            type: string\n          type: array\n        page_size:\n          description: |-\n            Specifies the maximum number of results to return in a single page.\n            If unspecified, a system default will be used.\n          format: int64\n          type: string\n        page_token:\n          description: |-\n            The continuation token, which is used to page through large result sets.\n            To get the next page of results, set this parameter to the value of\n            `nextPageToken` from the previous response.\n          type: string\n        phenotype_association_set_id:\n          title: The `PhenotypeAssociationSet` to search.
