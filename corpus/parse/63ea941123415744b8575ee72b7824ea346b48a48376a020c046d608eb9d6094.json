For each part in the list, you must provide the part number and the <code>ETag</code> value, returned after that part was uploaded.</p> <p>Processing of a Complete Multipart Upload request could take several minutes to complete. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that specifies a 200 OK response.

Because a request could fail after the initial 200 OK response has been sent, it is important that you check the response body to determine whether the request succeeded.</p> <p>Note that if <code>CompleteMultipartUpload</code> fails, applications should be prepared to retry the failed requests.

You create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic action using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy API. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html\">Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API</a>.</p> </note> <p>All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have <i>read</i> access to the source object and <i>write</i> access to the destination bucket. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html\">REST Authentication</a>. Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account.</p> <p>A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy action starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the <code>200 OK</code> response. This means that a <code>200 OK</code> response can contain either a success or an error. Design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately.</p> <p>If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object.</p> <note> <p>If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. If it were not, it would not contain the content-length, and you would need to read the entire body.</p> </note> <p>The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that you specify for the destination object. For pricing information, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/\">Amazon S3 pricing</a>.</p> <important> <p>Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If you request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a 400 <code>Bad Request</code> error. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html\">Transfer Acceleration</a>.</p> </important> <p> <b>Metadata</b> </p> <p>When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html\">Using ACLs</a>. </p> <p>To specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the source object or replaced with metadata provided in the request, you can optionally add the <code>x-amz-metadata-directive</code> header. When you grant permissions, you can use the <code>s3:x-amz-metadata-directive</code> condition key to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/amazon-s3-policy-keys.html\">Specifying Conditions in a Policy</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.

With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. For more information about server-side encryption, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html\">Using Server-Side Encryption</a>.</p> <p>If a target object uses SSE-KMS, you can enable an S3 Bucket Key for the object. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html\">Amazon S3 Bucket Keys</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers</b> </p> <p>When copying an object, you can optionally use headers to grant ACL-based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html\">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html\">Managing ACLs Using the REST API</a>. </p> <p> <b>Storage Class Options</b> </p> <p>You can use the <code>CopyObject</code> action to change the storage class of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3 using the <code>StorageClass</code> parameter. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html\">Storage Classes</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Versioning</b> </p> <p>By default, <code>x-amz-copy-source</code> identifies the current version of an object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use the <code>versionId</code> subresource.</p> <p>If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the <code>x-amz-version-id</code> response header in the response.</p> <p>If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null.</p> <p>If the source object''s storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy of this object before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation.

For information about bucket naming restrictions, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html\">Bucket naming rules</a>.</p> <p>If you want to create an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_CreateBucket.html\">Create Bucket</a>. </p> <p>By default, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You can optionally specify a Region in the request body. You might choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside in Europe, you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the Europe (Ireland) Region. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro\">Accessing a bucket</a>.</p> <note> <p>If you send your create bucket request to the <code>s3.amazonaws.com</code> endpoint, the request goes to the us-east-1 Region. Accordingly, the signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must use us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location constraint in the request specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html\">Virtual hosting of buckets</a>.</p> </note> <p>When creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the bucket. There are two ways to grant the appropriate permissions using the request headers.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL using the <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as <i>canned ACLs</i>. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL\">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly using the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. These headers map to the set of permissions Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html\">Access control list (ACL) overview</a>.</p> <p>You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>id</code> – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>uri</code> – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>emailAddress</code> – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account</p> <note> <p>Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions: </p> <ul> <li> <p>US East (N. Virginia)</p> </li> <li> <p>US West (N.

You cannot do both.</p> </note> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>If your <code>CreateBucket</code> request specifies ACL permissions and the ACL is public-read, public-read-write, authenticated-read, or if you specify access permissions explicitly through any other ACL, both <code>s3:CreateBucket</code> and <code>s3:PutBucketAcl</code> permissions are needed.

You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html\">UploadPart</a>). You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request.</p> <p>For more information about multipart uploads, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html\">Multipart Upload Overview</a>.</p> <p>If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the upload must complete within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort action and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config\">Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy</a>.</p> <p>For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html\">Multipart Upload and Permissions</a>.</p> <p>For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html\">Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)</a>.</p> <note> <p> After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload. </p> </note> <p>You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use Amazon Web Services KMS keys or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html\">UploadPart</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html\">UploadPartCopy</a> requests must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using <code>CreateMultipartUpload</code>. </p> <p>To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an Amazon Web Services KMS key, the requester must have permission to the <code>kms:Decrypt</code> and <code>kms:GenerateDataKey*</code> actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions\">Multipart upload API and permissions</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <p>If your Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same Amazon Web Services account as the KMS key, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs to a different account than the key, then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.</p> <p> For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html\">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption</a>.</p> <dl> <dt>Access Permissions</dt> <dd> <p>When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL with the <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL\">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly with the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html\">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.</p> </dd> <dt>Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers</dt> <dd> <p>You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption. Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you use depends on whether you want to use Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys or provide your own encryption key. </p> <ul> <li> <p>Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer managed key stored in Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) – If you want Amazon Web Services to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request.</p> <ul> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side-encryption</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side-encryption-context</p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>If you specify <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms</code>, but don''t provide <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</code>, Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web Services managed key in Amazon Web Services KMS to protect the data.</p> </note> <important> <p>All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by Amazon Web Services KMS fail if you don''t make them with SSL or by using SigV4.</p> </important> <p>For more information about server-side encryption with KMS key (SSE-KMS), see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html\">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request.</p> <ul> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS), see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html\">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </dd> <dt>Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers</dt> <dd> <p>You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the object. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html\">Using ACLs</a>. With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL (<code>x-amz-acl</code>) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as <i>canned ACLs</i>. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL\">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific Amazon Web Services accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html\">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>. In the header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions explicitly, use:</p> <ul> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-read</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-write</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-read-acp</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-write-acp</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-full-control</p> </li> </ul> <p>You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>id</code> – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>uri</code> – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>emailAddress</code> – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account</p> <note> <p>Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions: </p> <ul> <li> <p>US East (N.

Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html#sc-dynamic-data-access\">Storage class for automatically optimizing frequently and infrequently accessed objects</a>.</p> <p>Operations related to <code>PutBucketIntelligentTieringConfiguration</code> include: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketIntelligentTieringConfiguration.html\">DeleteBucketIntelligentTieringConfiguration</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketIntelligentTieringConfiguration.html\">GetBucketIntelligentTieringConfiguration</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListBucketIntelligentTieringConfigurations.html\">ListBucketIntelligentTieringConfigurations</a> </p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>You only need S3 Intelligent-Tiering enabled on a bucket if you want to automatically move objects stored in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class to the Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tier.</p> </note> <p class=\"title\"> <b>Special Errors</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p class=\"title\"> <b>HTTP 400 Bad Request Error</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>Code:</i> InvalidArgument</p> </li> <li> <p> <i>Cause:</i> Invalid Argument</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p class=\"title\"> <b>HTTP 400 Bad Request Error</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>Code:</i> TooManyConfigurations</p> </li> <li> <p> <i>Cause:</i> You are attempting to create a new configuration but have already reached the 1,000-configuration limit. </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p class=\"title\"> <b>HTTP 403 Forbidden Error</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>Code:</i> AccessDenied</p> </li> <li> <p> <i>Cause:</i> You are not the owner of the specified bucket, or you do not have the <code>s3:PutIntelligentTieringConfiguration</code> bucket permission to set the configuration on the bucket. </p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Success\n      parameters:\n        - name: Bucket\n          in: path\n          required: true\n          description: The name of the Amazon S3 bucket whose configuration you want to modify or retrieve.\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - name: id\n          in: query\n          required: true\n          description: The ID used to identify the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration.\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - name: intelligent-tiering\n          in: query\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: boolean\n            enum:\n              - true\n          allowEmptyValue: true\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          text/xml:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n              required:\n                - IntelligentTieringConfiguration\n              properties:\n                IntelligentTieringConfiguration:\n                  description: '<p>Specifies the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket.</p> <p>For information about the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html#sc-dynamic-data-access\">Storage class for automatically optimizing frequently and infrequently accessed objects</a>.</p>'\n                  type: object\n                  properties:\n                    Id:\n                      allOf:\n                        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/IntelligentTieringId'\n                        - description: The ID used to identify the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration.\n                    Filter:\n                      allOf:\n                        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/IntelligentTieringFilter'\n                        - description: Specifies a bucket filter.

The lifecycle configuration is specified as XML consisting of one or more rules. Each rule consists of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Filter identifying a subset of objects to which the rule applies. The filter can be based on a key name prefix, object tags, or a combination of both.</p> </li> <li> <p>Status whether the rule is in effect.</p> </li> <li> <p>One or more lifecycle transition and expiration actions that you want Amazon S3 to perform on the objects identified by the filter. If the state of your bucket is versioning-enabled or versioning-suspended, you can have many versions of the same object (one current version and zero or more noncurrent versions). Amazon S3 provides predefined actions that you can specify for current and noncurrent object versions.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html\">Object Lifecycle Management</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html\">Lifecycle Configuration Elements</a>.</p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>By default, all Amazon S3 resources are private, including buckets, objects, and related subresources (for example, lifecycle configuration and website configuration).

The resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by writing an access policy. For this operation, a user must get the s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration permission.</p> <p>You can also explicitly deny permissions. Explicit deny also supersedes any other permissions.

For example, you might override the Content-Disposition response header value in your GET request.</p> <p>You can override values for a set of response headers using the following query parameters. These response header values are sent only on a successful request, that is, when status code 200 OK is returned. The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The response headers that you can override for the GET response are <code>Content-Type</code>, <code>Content-Language</code>, <code>Expires</code>, <code>Cache-Control</code>, <code>Content-Disposition</code>, and <code>Content-Encoding</code>. To override these header values in the GET response, you use the following request parameters.</p> <note> <p>You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a presigned URL, when using these parameters. They cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request.</p> </note> <ul> <li> <p> <code>response-content-type</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>response-content-language</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>response-expires</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>response-cache-control</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>response-content-disposition</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>response-content-encoding</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Additional Considerations about Request Headers</b> </p> <p>If both of the <code>If-Match</code> and <code>If-Unmodified-Since</code> headers are present in the request as follows: <code>If-Match</code> condition evaluates to <code>true</code>, and; <code>If-Unmodified-Since</code> condition evaluates to <code>false</code>; then, S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested. </p> <p>If both of the <code>If-None-Match</code> and <code>If-Modified-Since</code> headers are present in the request as follows:<code> If-None-Match</code> condition evaluates to <code>false</code>, and; <code>If-Modified-Since</code> condition evaluates to <code>true</code>; then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified response code.</p> <p>For more information about conditional requests, see <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232\">RFC 7232</a>.</p> <p>The following operations are related to <code>GetObject</code>:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListBuckets.html\">ListBuckets</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAcl.html\">GetObjectAcl</a> </p> </li> </ul>'\n      externalDocs:\n        url: 'http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectGET.html'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Success\n          content:\n            text/xml:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/GetObjectOutput'\n        '480':\n          description: NoSuchKey\n          content:\n            text/xml:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/NoSuchKey'\n        '481':\n          description: InvalidObjectState\n          content:\n            text/xml:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/InvalidObjectState'\n      parameters:\n        - name: Bucket\n          in: path\n          required: true\n          description: '<p>The bucket name containing the object. </p> <p>When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname.

If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this action provides a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.</p> <p>The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete action and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in the response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.</p> <p> The action supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the action uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete action encountered an error. For a successful deletion, the action does not return any information about the delete in the response body.</p> <p>When performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete\"> MFA Delete</a>.</p> <p>Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests.

For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html\">Using ACLs</a>. To set the ACL of a bucket, you must have <code>WRITE_ACP</code> permission.</p> <p>You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket''s permissions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify the ACL in the request body</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify permissions using request headers</p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>You cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request headers.</p> </note> <p>Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that approach.</p> <p> <b>Access Permissions</b> </p> <p>You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL with the <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as <i>canned ACLs</i>. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of <code>x-amz-acl</code>. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL\">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly with the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the <code>x-amz-acl</code> header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html\">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>.</p> <p>You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>id</code> – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>uri</code> – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>emailAddress</code> – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account</p> <note> <p>Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions: </p> <ul> <li> <p>US East (N. Virginia)</p> </li> <li> <p>US West (N. California)</p> </li> <li> <p> US West (Oregon)</p> </li> <li> <p> Asia Pacific (Singapore)</p> </li> <li> <p>Asia Pacific (Sydney)</p> </li> <li> <p>Asia Pacific (Tokyo)</p> </li> <li> <p>Europe (Ireland)</p> </li> <li> <p>South America (São Paulo)</p> </li> </ul> <p>For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region\">Regions and Endpoints</a> in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.</p> </note> </li> </ul> <p>For example, the following <code>x-amz-grant-write</code> header grants create, overwrite, and delete objects permission to LogDelivery group predefined by Amazon S3 and two Amazon Web Services accounts identified by their email addresses.</p> <p> <code>x-amz-grant-write: uri=\"http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery\", id=\"111122223333\", id=\"555566667777\" </code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.</p> <p> <b>Grantee Values</b> </p> <p>You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you''re assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p>By the person''s ID:</p> <p> <code>&lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"CanonicalUser\"&gt;&lt;ID&gt;&lt;&gt;ID&lt;&gt;&lt;/ID&gt;&lt;DisplayName&gt;&lt;&gt;GranteesEmail&lt;&gt;&lt;/DisplayName&gt; &lt;/Grantee&gt;</code> </p> <p>DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request</p> </li> <li> <p>By URI:</p> <p> <code>&lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"Group\"&gt;&lt;URI&gt;&lt;&gt;http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers&lt;&gt;&lt;/URI&gt;&lt;/Grantee&gt;</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>By Email address:</p> <p> <code>&lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"AmazonCustomerByEmail\"&gt;&lt;EmailAddress&gt;&lt;&gt;Grantees@email.com&lt;&gt;&lt;/EmailAddress&gt;lt;/Grantee&gt;</code> </p> <p>The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser. </p> <note> <p>Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions: </p> <ul> <li> <p>US East (N.

For information about lifecycle configuration, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html\">Object Lifecycle Management</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. </p> <p>By default, all Amazon S3 resources, including buckets, objects, and related subresources (for example, lifecycle configuration and website configuration) are private. Only the resource owner, the Amazon Web Services account that created the resource, can access it. The resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by writing an access policy. For this operation, users must get the <code>s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration</code> permission.</p> <p>You can also explicitly deny permissions. Explicit denial also supersedes any other permissions. If you want to prevent users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them permissions for the following actions: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>s3:DeleteObject</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>s3:DeleteObjectVersion</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about permissions, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html\">Managing Access Permissions to your Amazon S3 Resources</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more examples of transitioning objects to storage classes such as STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html#lifecycle-configuration-examples\">Examples of Lifecycle Configuration</a>.</p> <p class=\"title\"> <b>Related Resources</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketLifecycle.html\">GetBucketLifecycle</a>(Deprecated)</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html\">GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html\">RestoreObject</a> </p> </li> <li> <p>By default, a resource owner—in this case, a bucket owner, which is the Amazon Web Services account that created the bucket—can perform any of the operations.

Specify the canned ACL name as the value of <code>x-amz-ac</code>l. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL\">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly with the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use <code>x-amz-acl</code> header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html\">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>.</p> <p>You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>id</code> – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>uri</code> – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>emailAddress</code> – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account</p> <note> <p>Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions: </p> <ul> <li> <p>US East (N.

For an overview about select requests, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html\">Querying Archived Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <p>When making a select request, do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Define an output location for the select query''s output. This must be an Amazon S3 bucket in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the bucket that contains the archive object that is being queried. The Amazon Web Services account that initiates the job must have permissions to write to the S3 bucket. You can specify the storage class and encryption for the output objects stored in the bucket. For more information about output, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html\">Querying Archived Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information about the <code>S3</code> structure in the request body, see the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html\">PutObject</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html\">Managing Access with ACLs</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html\">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i> </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Define the SQL expression for the <code>SELECT</code> type of restoration for your query in the request body''s <code>SelectParameters</code> structure. You can use expressions like the following examples.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The following expression returns all records from the specified object.</p> <p> <code>SELECT * FROM Object</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in the object, you can specify columns with positional headers.</p> <p> <code>SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 &gt; 100</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>If you have headers and you set the <code>fileHeaderInfo</code> in the <code>CSV</code> structure in the request body to <code>USE</code>, you can specify headers in the query. (If you set the <code>fileHeaderInfo</code> field to <code>IGNORE</code>, the first row is skipped for the query.) You cannot mix ordinal positions with header column names. </p> <p> <code>SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN FROM S3Object s</code> </p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about using SQL with S3 Glacier Select restore, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-glacier-select-sql-reference.html\">SQL Reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. </p> <p>When making a select request, you can also do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>To expedite your queries, specify the <code>Expedited</code> tier. For more information about tiers, see \"Restoring Archives,\" later in this topic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify details about the data serialization format of both the input object that is being queried and the serialization of the CSV-encoded query results.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The following are additional important facts about the select feature:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive retrievals, they are stored until explicitly deleted-manually or through a lifecycle policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3 object. Amazon S3 doesn''t deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing duplicate requests.</p> </li> <li> <p> Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already been restored. A select request doesn’t return error response <code>409</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Restoring objects</b> </p> <p>Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers are not accessible in real time. For objects in Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier. For objects in S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is available. To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify.</p> <p>To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don''t provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.</p> <p>When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the <code>Tier</code> element of the request body: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <b> <code>Expedited</code> </b> - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b> <code>Standard</code> </b> - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b> <code>Bulk</code> </b> - Bulk retrievals are the lowest-cost retrieval option in S3 Glacier, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for <code>Expedited</code> data access, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html\">Restoring Archived Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. </p> <p>You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html\"> Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. </p> <p>To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <code>HEAD</code> request. Operations return the <code>x-amz-restore</code> header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html\">Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <p>After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object.</p> <p>If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html\">PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html\">Object Lifecycle Management</a> in <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Responses</b> </p> <p>A successful action returns either the <code>200 OK</code> or <code>202 Accepted</code> status code. </p> <ul> <li> <p>If the object is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns <code>202 Accepted</code> in the response. </p> </li> <li> <p>If the object is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns <code>200 OK</code> in the response. </p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"title\"> <b>Special Errors</b> </p> <ul> <li> <ul> <li> <p> <i>Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress</i> </p> </li> <li> <p> <i>Cause: Object restore is already in progress.

However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you use the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html\">UploadPartCopy</a> operation. </p> </note> <p>You must initiate a multipart upload (see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html\">CreateMultipartUpload</a>) before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must include in your upload part request.</p> <p>Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload.</p> <p>To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the <code>Content-MD5</code> header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error. </p> <p>If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then Amazon Web Services S3 uses the <code>x-amz-content-sha256</code> header as a checksum instead of <code>Content-MD5</code>.

When <code>WriteGetObjectResponse</code> is called by a customer-owned Lambda function, the metadata returned to the end user <code>GetObject</code> call might differ from what Amazon S3 would normally return.</p> <p>You can include any number of metadata headers.
