A single `Reference` might represent the human chromosome 1, for instance. `References` are designed to be immutable.\n      type: object\n      properties:\n        additionalInfo:\n          additionalProperties:\n            type: string\n          description: Additional arbitrary info\n          type: object\n        referenceDbId:\n          description: The reference ID. Unique within the repository.\n          type: string\n          example: fc0a81d0\n        referenceSetDbId:\n          description: The reference ID. Unique within the repository.\n          type: string\n          example: c1ecfef1\n        isDerived:\n          description: A sequence X is said to be derived from source sequence Y, if X and Y are of the same length and the per-base sequence divergence at A/C/G/T bases is sufficiently small. Two sequences derived from the same official sequence share the same coordinates and annotations, and can be replaced with the official sequence for certain use cases.\n          format: boolean\n          type: boolean\n          example: false\n        length:\n          description: The length of this reference's sequence.\n          type: integer\n          example: 50000000\n        md5checksum:\n          description: The MD5 checksum uniquely representing this `Reference` as a lower-case hexadecimal string, calculated as the MD5 of the upper-case sequence excluding all whitespace characters (this is equivalent to SQ:M5 in SAM).\n          type: string\n          example: c2365e900c81a89cf74d83dab60df146\n        referenceName:\n          description: The unique name of this reference within the Reference Set.\n          type: string\n          example: Chromosome 2\n        sourceAccessions:\n          description: All known corresponding accession IDs in INSDC (GenBank/ENA/DDBJ) which must include a version number, e.g. `GCF_000001405.26`.\n          items:\n            type: string\n          type: array\n          example: [\"GCF_000001405.26\"]\n        sourceDivergence:\n          description: The `sourceDivergence` is the fraction of non-indel bases that do not match the reference this message was derived from.\n          format: float\n          type: number\n          example: 0.01\n        sourceURI:\n          description: The URI from which the sequence was obtained. Specifies a FASTA format file/string with one name, sequence pair. In most cases, clients should call the `getReferenceBases()` method to obtain sequence bases for a `Reference` instead of attempting to retrieve this URI.\n          type: string\n          example: https://wiki.brapi.org/files/demo.fast\n        species:\n          $ref: '#/components/schemas/OntologyTerm'\n\n"
