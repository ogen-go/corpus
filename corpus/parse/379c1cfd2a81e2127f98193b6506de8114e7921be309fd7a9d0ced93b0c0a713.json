Values supplied in this\n            method's log_name, resource, and labels fields are copied into those\n            log entries in this list that do not include values for their\n            corresponding fields. For more information, see the LogEntry type.If\n            the timestamp or insert_id fields are missing in log entries, then\n            this method supplies the current time or a unique identifier,\n            respectively. The supplied values are chosen so that, among the log\n            entries that did not supply their own values, the entries earlier in\n            the list will sort before the entries later in the list. See the\n            entries.list method.Log entries with timestamps that are more than\n            the logs retention period in the past or more than 24 hours in the\n            future will not be available when calling entries.list. However,\n            those log entries can still be exported with LogSinks.To improve\n            throughput and to avoid exceeding the quota limit for calls to\n            entries.write, you should try to include several log entries in this\n            list, rather than calling this method for each individual log entry.\n          items:\n            $ref: \"#/components/schemas/LogEntry\"\n          type: array\n        labels:\n          additionalProperties:\n            type: string\n          description: Optional. Default labels that are added to the labels field of all\n            log entries in entries. If a log entry already has a label with the\n            same key as a label in this parameter, then the log entry's label is\n            not changed. See LogEntry.\n          type: object\n        logName:\n          description: \u003e-\n            Optional. A default log resource name that is assigned to all log\n            entries in entries that do not specify a value for log_name:\n\n            \"projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\"\n\n            \"organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\"\n\n            \"billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\"\n\n            \"folders/[FOLDER_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\"\n\n            [LOG_ID] must be URL-encoded.

Whether valid entries should be written even if some other\n            entries fail due to INVALID_ARGUMENT or PERMISSION_DENIED errors. If\n            any entry is not written, then the response status is the error\n            associated with one of the failed entries and the response includes\n            error details keyed by the entries' zero-based index in the\n            entries.write method.\n          type: boolean\n        resource:\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/MonitoredResource\"\n      type: object\n    WriteLogEntriesResponse:\n      description: Result returned from WriteLogEntries. empty\n      properties: {}\n      type: object\n",
