Banks are required to\n                indicate on the Call Report whether there is currently in effect an\n                election to file under Subchapter S. Thrifts have a similar\n                requirement as of March 1998.  The most important IRS requirements\n                to elect and maintain Subchapter S status are: There can be no more\n                than 75 eligible shareholders and no more than one class of stock.\n                (In general, shareholders can only be individuals, estates, and\n                certain types of trusts. Certain retirement plans and charitable\n                organizations will be eligible in 1998.) All shareholders must\n                consent.  Banks and thrifts converting to Subchapter S status must\n                use the specific charge-off method for tax purposes rather than the\n                reserve method of accounting for bad debts and recapture tax bad\n                debt reserves over a period of six years, if the reserve method had\n                been used prior to conversion. (Note: even though the specific\n                charge-off method is required for tax purposes, an adequate\n                allowance for loan and lease losses must still be maintained on the\n                financial statements and Call Reports.) Banks and thrifts are\n                subject to a built-in gains (BIG) tax, if the aggregate fair market\n                value of assets is greater than their aggregate adjusted bases on\n                the date of conversion to Subchapter S status.     [Banks are\n                required to indicate separately on the Call Report in December of\n                each year, the deferred portion of income taxes reported in net\n                income. For Subchapter S banks, some or all of their deferred tax\n                assets and liabilities may be eliminated upon conversion to\n                Subchapter S status; however, deferred taxes related to the BIG tax\n                and the recapture of bad debt reserves must be recognized.].   A\n                Subchapter S corporation is treated as a pass-through entity,\n                similar to a partnership, for federal income tax purposes. It is\n                generally not subject to any federal income taxes at the corporate\n                level. Its taxable income flows through to its shareholders in\n                proportion to their stock ownership, and the shareholders generally\n                pay federal income taxes on their share of this taxable income. This\n                can have the effect of reducing institutions' reported income tax\n                expense and increasing their after-tax earnings..   The election of\n                Subchapter S status may result in an increase in shareholders'\n                personal tax liabilities. Therefore, S corporations typically\n                increase the amount of earnings distributed as dividends to\n                compensate for higher personal taxes.\n              type: string\n              x-source-mapping:\n                -

In 1989, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) specified that thereafter the FDIC would be the federal deposit insurer of all banks and savings associations and would administer both the FDIC fund, which was renamed the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the replacement for the insolvent FSLIC fund, which was called the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). Although it was created in 1989, the SAIF was not responsible for savings association failures until 1996. From 1989 through 1995, savings association failures were the responsibility of the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). In February 2006, The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 provided for the merger of the BIF and the SAIF into a single Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). Necessary technical and conforming changes to the law were made under The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Conforming Amendments Act of 2005. The merger of the funds was effective on March 31, 2006.

The transaction types outlined below can be grouped into three general categories, based upon the method employed to protect insured depositors and how each transaction affects a failed / assisted institution's charter. In most assistance transactions, insured and uninsured depositors are protected, the failed / assisted institution remains open and its charter survives the resolution process. In purchase and assumption transactions, the failed / assisted institution's insured deposits are transferred to a successor institution, and its charter is closed. In most of these transactions, additional liabilities and assets are also transferred to the successor institution. In payoff transactions, the deposit insurer - the FDIC or the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation - pays insured depositors, the failed / assisted institution's charter is closed, and there is no successor institution. For a more complete description of resolution transactions and the FDIC's receivership activities, see Managing the Crisis: The FDIC and RTC Experience, a study prepared by the FDIC's Division of Resolutions and Receiverships. Copies are available from the FDIC's Public Information Center.\n                Category 1 - Institution's charter survives\n                A/A\t- Assistance Transactions. These include: 1) transactions where assistance was provided to the acquirer, who purchased the entire institution. For a few FSLIC transactions, the acquirer purchased the entire bridge bank - type entity, but certain other assets were moved into a liquidating receivership prior to the sale, and 2) open bank assistance transactions, including those where assistance was provided under a systemic risk determination (in such cases any costs that exceed the amounts estimated under the least cost resolution requirement would be recovered through a special assessment on all FDIC-insured institutions).\n                REP -\tReprivatization, management takeover with or without assistance at takeover, followed by a sale with or without additional assistance.\n                Category 2 - Institution's charter is terminated, insured deposits plus some assets and other liabilities are transferred to a successor charter\n                P\u0026A - Purchase and Assumption, where some or all of the deposits, certain other liabilities and a portion of the assets (sometimes all of the assets) were sold to an acquirer. It was not determined if all of the deposits (PA) or only the insured deposits (PI) were assumed.\n                PA - Purchase and Assumption, where the insured and uninsured deposits, certain other liabilities and a portion of the assets were sold to an acquirer.\n                PI - Purchase and Assumption of the insured deposits only, where the traditional P\u0026A was modified so that only the insured deposits were assumed by the acquiring institution.\n                IDT - Insured Deposit Transfer, where the acquiring institution served as a paying agent for the insurer, established accounts on their books for depositors, and often acquired some assets as well. Includes ABT (asset-backed transfer, a FSLIC transaction that is very similar to an IDT).\n                MGR - An institution where FSLIC took over management and generally provided financial assistance. FSLIC closed down before the institution was sold.\n                Category 3\n                PO - Payout, where the insurer paid the depositors directly and placed the assets in a liquidating receivership.

Estimated losses reflect unpaid principal amounts deemed unrecoverable and do not reflect interest that may be due on the DIF's administrative or subrogated claims should its principal be repaid in full.\n                Notes:\n                Comprehensive data on estimated losses are not available for FDIC-insured failures prior to 1986, or for FSLIC-insured failures from 1934-88. Estimated loss is presented as \"N/A\" in years for which comprehensive information is not available.\n                Estimated Loss data was previously referred to as 'Estimated Cost' in past releases of the Historical Statistic on Banking. For RTC receiverships, the 'Estimated Cost' included an allocation of FDIC corporate revenue and expense items such as interest expense on Federal Financing Bank debt, interest expense on escrowed funds and interest revenue on advances to receiverships. Other FDIC receiverships did not include such an allocation. To maintain consistency with FDIC receiverships, the RTC allocation is no longer reflected in the estimated loss amounts for failed / assisted institutions that were resolved through RTC receiverships.\n                Beginning with the release of 2007 information, the 'Estimated Loss' in the Historical Statistics on Banking is presented and defined consistently with the aggregate Estimated Receivership Loss for FRF-RTC institutions and Estimated Losses for FDIC receiverships that are reported in the FDIC's Annual Report. The estimated loss is obtained from the FDIC's Failed Bank Cost Analysis (FBCA) report and the RTC Loss report. The FBCA provides data for receiverships back to 1986. The RTC Loss Report provides similar data back to 1989.\n                Questions regarding Estimated Loss should be sent to DOFBusinessCenter@fdic.gov.\n                Also, for more detail regarding resolution transactions and the FDIC's receivership activities, see Managing the Crisis: The FDIC and RTC Experience, a historical study prepared by the FDIC's Division of Resolutions and Receiverships.

Now, parent institutions\n                are required to file consolidated reports, while their subsidiary\n                financial institutions are still required to file separate\n                reports.\n              type: string\n              x-source-mapping:\n                - file: RISVIEW\n                  field: PARCERT\n            L_REPDTE:\n              title: Report Date\n              description: The last day of the financial reporting period selected.\n              type: string\n              x-elastic-type: keyword\n              x-source-mapping:\n                - file: RISVIEW_MERGED\n                  field: L_REPDTE\n            REPDTE_RAW:\n              title: Report Date\n              description: The last day of the financial reporting period selected.\n              type: string\n              x-elastic-type: keyword\n              x-source-mapping:\n                - file: RISVIEW\n                  field: REPDTE\n                - file: RISVIEW_MERGED\n                  field: REPDTE\n            REPDTE:\n              title: Report Date\n              description: The last day of the financial reporting period selected.\n              type: string\n              x-elastic-type: keyword\n              x-source-mapping:\n                - file: RISVIEW\n                  field: REPDTE\n                - file: RISVIEW_MERGED\n                  field: REPDTE\n            RISDATE:\n              title: Report Date\n              description: The financial reporting period selected in CCYYMM format.\n              type: string\n              format: date-time\n              x-source-mapping:\n                - file: RISVIEW\n                  field: REPDTE\n                - file: RISVIEW_MERGED\n                  field: REPDTE\n            ROA:\n              title: Return on assets (ROA)\n              description: \u003e-\n                Net income after taxes and extraordinary items (annualized) as a\n                percent of average total assets.\n              type: number\n              x-elastic-type: double\n              x-source-mapping:\n                - file: RISVIEW\n                  field: ROA\n            ROAPTX:\n              title: Pretax return on assets\n              description: \u003e-\n                Annualized pre-tax net income as a percent of average assets.

Banks are required to\n                indicate on the Call Report whether there is currently in effect an\n                election to file under Subchapter S. Thrifts have a similar\n                requirement as of March 1998.  The most important IRS requirements\n                to elect and maintain Subchapter S status are: There can be no more\n                than 75 eligible shareholders and no more than one class of stock.\n                (In general, shareholders can only be individuals, estates, and\n                certain types of trusts. Certain retirement plans and charitable\n                organizations will be eligible in 1998.) All shareholders must\n                consent.  Banks and thrifts converting to Subchapter S status must\n                use the specific charge-off method for tax purposes rather than the\n                reserve method of accounting for bad debts and recapture tax bad\n                debt reserves over a period of six years, if the reserve method had\n                been used prior to conversion. (Note: even though the specific\n                charge-off method is required for tax purposes, an adequate\n                allowance for loan and lease losses must still be maintained on the\n                financial statements and Call Reports.) Banks and thrifts are\n                subject to a built-in gains (BIG) tax, if the aggregate fair market\n                value of assets is greater than their aggregate adjusted bases on\n                the date of conversion to Subchapter S status.     [Banks are\n                required to indicate separately on the Call Report in December of\n                each year, the deferred portion of income taxes reported in net\n                income. For Subchapter S banks, some or all of their deferred tax\n                assets and liabilities may be eliminated upon conversion to\n                Subchapter S status; however, deferred taxes related to the BIG tax\n                and the recapture of bad debt reserves must be recognized.].   A\n                Subchapter S corporation is treated as a pass-through entity,\n                similar to a partnership, for federal income tax purposes. It is\n                generally not subject to any federal income taxes at the corporate\n                level. Its taxable income flows through to its shareholders in\n                proportion to their stock ownership, and the shareholders generally\n                pay federal income taxes on their share of this taxable income. This\n                can have the effect of reducing institutions' reported income tax\n                expense and increasing their after-tax earnings..   The election of\n                Subchapter S status may result in an increase in shareholders'\n                personal tax liabilities. Therefore, S corporations typically\n                increase the amount of earnings distributed as dividends to\n                compensate for higher personal taxes.\n              type: number\n              x-source-mapping:\n                - file: RISVIEW\n                  field: SUBCHAPS\n            TRACT:\n              title: ''\n              description: \u003e-\n                Beyond having trust powers granted and exercised, institutions with\n                fiduciary assets accounts, income, or other reportable fiduciary\n                related service\n              type: string\n              x-source-mapping:\n                - file: RISVIEW\n                  field: TRACT\n            TRUST:\n              title: Trust Powers\n              description: \u003e-\n                A flag used to indicate an institution's Trust Powers Granted\n                status. 0 = No Trust Power Granted 1 = Trust Power Granted Where\n                Trust Power has been granted specific codes are: 00 - Trust powers\n                not know 10 - Full trust powers granted 11 - Full trust powers\n                granted, exercised 12 - Full trust powers granted, not exercised 20\n                - Limited trust powers granted 21 - Limited trust powers granted,\n                exercised 22 - Limited trust powers granted, not exercised 30 -\n                Trust powers not granted 31 - Trust powers not granted, but\n                exercised\n              type: string\n              x-source-mapping:\n                - file: RISVIEW\n                  field: TRUST\n            ACEPT:\n              title: BANKS LIABILITY ON ACCEPTANCES\n              description:\n              type: number\n              x-source-mapping:\n                - file: RISVIEW\n                  field: ACEPT\n            ACTIVE:\n              title: ACTIVE INSTITUTION FLAG\n              description:\n              type: number\n              x-source-mapping:\n                - file: RISVIEW\n                  field: ACTIVE\n            BKCLASS:\n              title: INSTITUTION CLASS\n              description:\n                A classification code assigned by the FDIC based on the institution's charter type (commercial bank or savings institution), charter agent (state or federal), Federal Reserve membership status (Fed member, Fed non-member) and its primary federal regulator (state chartered institutions are subject to both federal and state supervision).
