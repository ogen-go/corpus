This guide provides information about the Amazon Pinpoint Email API (version 1.0), including supported operations, data types, parameters, and schemas.  Amazon Pinpoint is an AWS service that you can use to engage with your customers across multiple messaging channels. You can use Amazon Pinpoint to send email, SMS text messages, voice messages, and push notifications. The Amazon Pinpoint Email API provides programmatic access to options that are unique to the email channel and supplement the options provided by the Amazon Pinpoint API. If you're new to Amazon Pinpoint, you might find it helpful to also review the Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide. The Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide provides tutorials, code samples, and procedures that demonstrate how to use Amazon Pinpoint features programmatically and how to integrate Amazon Pinpoint functionality into mobile apps and other types of applications. The guide also provides information about key topics such as Amazon Pinpoint integration with other AWS services and the limits that apply to using the service. The Amazon Pinpoint Email API is available in several AWS Regions and it provides an endpoint for each of these Regions. For a list of all the Regions and endpoints where the API is currently available, see AWS Service Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. To learn more about AWS Regions, see Managing AWS Regions in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These Availability Zones are physically isolated from each other, but are united by private, low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network connections. These Availability Zones enable us to provide very high levels of availability and redundancy, while also minimizing latency. To learn more about the number of Availability Zones that are available in each Region, see AWS Global Infrastructure.\",\n    \"x-logo\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chainjet/assets/master/integrations/aws/Arch_AWS-Simple-Email-Service_64.svg\"\n    },\n    \"termsOfService\": \"https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/\",\n    \"contact\": {\n      \"name\": \"Mike Ralphson\",\n      \"email\": \"mike.ralphson@gmail.com\",\n      \"url\": \"https://github.com/mermade/aws2openapi\",\n      \"x-twitter\": \"PermittedSoc\"\n    },\n    \"license\": {\n      \"name\": \"Apache 2.0 License\",\n      \"url\": \"http://www.apache.org/licenses/\"\n    },\n    \"x-providerName\": \"amazonaws.com\",\n    \"x-serviceName\": \"pinpoint-email\",\n    \"x-origin\": [\n      {\n        \"contentType\": \"application/json\",\n        \"url\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/pinpoint-email-2018-07-26.normal.json\",\n        \"converter\": {\n          \"url\": \"https://github.com/mermade/aws2openapi\",\n          \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n        },\n        \"x-apisguru-driver\": \"external\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"x-apiClientRegistration\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html?nc2=h_ct\"\n    },\n    \"x-apisguru-categories\": [\"cloud\"],\n    \"x-preferred\": true,\n    \"x-deprecated\": true\n  },\n  \"externalDocs\": {\n    \"description\": \"Amazon Web Services documentation\",\n    \"url\": \"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/email/\"\n  },\n  \"servers\": [\n    {\n      \"url\": \"http://email.{region}.amazonaws.com\",\n      \"variables\": {\n        \"region\": {\n          \"description\": \"The AWS region\",\n          \"enum\": [\n            \"us-east-1\",\n            \"us-east-2\",\n            \"us-west-1\",\n            \"us-west-2\",\n            \"us-gov-west-1\",\n            \"us-gov-east-1\",\n            \"ca-central-1\",\n            \"eu-north-1\",\n            \"eu-west-1\",\n            \"eu-west-2\",\n            \"eu-west-3\",\n            \"eu-central-1\",\n            \"eu-south-1\",\n            \"af-south-1\",\n            \"ap-northeast-1\",\n            \"ap-northeast-2\",\n            \"ap-northeast-3\",\n            \"ap-southeast-1\",\n            \"ap-southeast-2\",\n            \"ap-east-1\",\n            \"ap-south-1\",\n            \"sa-east-1\",\n            \"me-south-1\"\n          ],\n          \"default\": \"us-east-1\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"description\": \"The Pinpoint Email multi-region endpoint\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://email.{region}.amazonaws.com\",\n      \"variables\": {\n        \"region\": {\n          \"description\": \"The AWS region\",\n          \"enum\": [\n            \"us-east-1\",\n            \"us-east-2\",\n            \"us-west-1\",\n            \"us-west-2\",\n            \"us-gov-west-1\",\n            \"us-gov-east-1\",\n            \"ca-central-1\",\n            \"eu-north-1\",\n            \"eu-west-1\",\n            \"eu-west-2\",\n            \"eu-west-3\",\n            \"eu-central-1\",\n            \"eu-south-1\",\n            \"af-south-1\",\n            \"ap-northeast-1\",\n            \"ap-northeast-2\",\n            \"ap-northeast-3\",\n            \"ap-southeast-1\",\n            \"ap-southeast-2\",\n            \"ap-east-1\",\n            \"ap-south-1\",\n            \"sa-east-1\",\n            \"me-south-1\"\n          ],\n          \"default\": \"us-east-1\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"description\": \"The Pinpoint Email multi-region endpoint\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"http://email.{region}.amazonaws.com.cn\",\n      \"variables\": {\n        \"region\": {\n          \"description\": \"The AWS region\",\n          \"enum\": [\"cn-north-1\", \"cn-northwest-1\"],\n          \"default\": \"cn-north-1\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"description\": \"The Pinpoint Email endpoint for China (Beijing) and China (Ningxia)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://email.{region}.amazonaws.com.cn\",\n      \"variables\": {\n        \"region\": {\n          \"description\": \"The AWS region\",\n          \"enum\": [\"cn-north-1\", \"cn-northwest-1\"],\n          \"default\": \"cn-north-1\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"description\": \"The Pinpoint Email endpoint for China (Beijing) and China (Ningxia)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"x-hasEquivalentPaths\": true,\n  \"paths\": {\n    \"/v1/email/configuration-sets\": {\n      \"post\": {\n        \"operationId\": \"CreateConfigurationSet\",\n        \"description\": \"Create a configuration set. \u003ci\u003eConfiguration sets\u003c/i\u003e are groups of rules that you can apply to the emails you send using Amazon Pinpoint.

A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003e \u003cp\u003eTag keys and values are case sensitive.\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one value.\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe \u003ccode\u003eaws:\u003c/code\u003e prefix is reserved for use by AWS; you can’t use it in any tag keys or values that you define.
