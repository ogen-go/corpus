We also integrated other network data providers.\n    This chapter gives an overview about the options you have.\n\n    ## OpenStreetMap\n\n    #### Geographical Coverage\n\n    [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) covers the whole world. If you want to see for yourself if we can provide data suitable for your region,\n    please visit [GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps/).\n    You can edit and modify OpenStreetMap data if you find that important information is missing, e.g. a weight limit for a bridge.\n    [Here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_guide) is a beginner's guide that shows how to add data. If you have edited data, we usually consider your data after 1 week at the latest.\n\n    #### Supported Vehicle Profiles\n\n    The Routing, Matrix and Route Optimization APIs support the following vehicle profiles:\n\n    Name       | Description           | Restrictions              | Icon\n    -----------|:----------------------|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------\n    car        | Car mode              | car access                | ![car image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/car.png)\n    small_truck| Small truck like a Mercedes Sprinter, Ford Transit or Iveco Daily | height=2.7m, width=2+0.4m, length=5.5m, weight=2080+1400 kg | ![small truck image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/small_truck.png)\n    truck      | Truck like a MAN or Mercedes-Benz Actros | height=3.7m, width=2.6+0.5m, length=12m, weight=13000 + 13000 kg, hgv=yes, 3 Axes | ![truck image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/truck.png)\n    scooter    | Moped mode | Fast inner city, often used for food delivery, is able to ignore certain bollards, maximum speed of roughly 50km/h | ![scooter image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/scooter.png)\n    foot       | Pedestrian or walking without dangerous [SAC-scales](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:sac_scale) | foot access         | ![foot image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/foot.png)\n    hike       | Pedestrian or walking with priority for more beautiful hiking tours and potentially a bit longer than `foot`.

Analyze the solution on the **Map** or as raw **JSON Output**\n\n      If you have successfully solved the first problem, we recommend this tutorial - [Getting Started with the Optimization API](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2019/05/17/getting-started-with-the-optimization-api-traveling-salesman-problem/).\n      It shows and describes the essential elements to model your vehicle routing problem.\n\n      To explore the full specification, we recommend that you either use our [route editor](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2015/07/21/graphhoppers-new-route-optimization-editor/),\n      which you can find in our [dashboard](https://graphhopper.com/dashboard/),\n      or use a REST client such as Insomnia or Postman, as described [here](https://docs.graphhopper.com/#section/Explore-our-APIs/Insomnia).\n\n      ## Tutorials\n\n      We provide [a number of tutorials](https://www.graphhopper.com/tutorial/) illustrating how to use the Route Optimization API and\n      how to model your vehicle routing problems:\n\n      - [Getting Start with the Optimization API - Traveling Salesman Problem](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2019/05/17/getting-started-with-the-optimization-api-traveling-salesman-problem/)\n      - [How to solve a traveling salesman problem with a week-planning horizon?](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2020/07/15/how-to-solve-a-traveling-salesman-problem-with-a-week-planning-horizon-and-driver-shifts/)\n      - [How to schedule technicians with skills and multiple dependencies between tasks?](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2016/06/03/how-to-route-technicians-with-skills-and-multiple-dependencies-between-tasks/)\n      - [What is the difference between the min. of completion time and min. transport time?](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2016/06/20/what-is-the-difference-between-the-minimization-of-completion-time-and-minimizing-transport-time/)\n      - [How to model multiple delivery routes with a single vehicle?](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2016/07/21/how-to-model-multiple-delivery-routes-with-a-single-vehicle/)\n    name: Route Optimization API\n  - description: |\n      \n      ### Introduction\n\n      ![Routing screenshot](./img/routing-example.png)\n\n      The Routing API is part of the GraphHopper Directions API. Routing is the process of finding the best path connecting\n      two or more points, where the meaning of ''best'' depends on the vehicle and use case.\n\n      ### Navigation\n      If you plan to use the Routing API for navigation, have a look at our [open source demo navigation application](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-navigation-example) and adapt it to your needs.\n\n      ### Fast\n      To get started using this API, just provide two or more points and retrieve the fastest route through the road\n      network that connects them. This type of request is heavily optimized for query performance, so it does not\n      allow for some advanced features.\n      ### Flexible\n      Unlock further flexible features via `ch.disable=true`.\n    name: Routing API\n  - description: |\n      \n      ### Introduction\n\n      ![Matrix Example](./img/matrix-example.png)\n\n      The Matrix API is part of the [GraphHopper Directions API](https://graphhopper.com/#directions-api) and with\n      it you can calculate many-to-many distances and times a lot more efficient than calling the\n      Routing API multiple times.\n\n      In the [Routing API](#tag/Routing-API) we support multiple points, so called 'via points', which results in one\n      route being calculated. The Matrix API results in NxM routes, or more precise NxM distances or times being calculated\n      but [is a lot faster](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2019/06/04/incredibly-fast-distance-matrix-calculations-with-graphhopper/)\n      compared to NxM single requests.\n\n      The most simple example is a tourist trying to decide\n      which pizza is close to her instead of using beeline distance she can calculate a 1x4 matrix. Or a delivery service\n      often in the need of big NxN matrices to solve vehicle routing problems. For example the [GraphHopper Route Optimization API](#tag/Route-Optimization-API)\n      uses the Matrix API under the hood to achieve this.\n\n      Some other use cases for the Matrix API:\n\n      * Logistic problems often pick up many items from and deliver them to many locations.\n      * Calculating detours with many possible points in-between and selecting the best e.g. interesting for ridesharing or taxi applications. For this 1-to-many requests are necessary.\n      * Finding the best tour for a tourist in the need to visit as many points of interests as possible.\n      * ...\n\n      ### API Clients and Examples\n\n      See the [clients](#section/API-Clients) section in the main document and [live examples](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/examples/#matrix).\n\n      ### Description\n\n      The Matrix API calculates the well known distance-matrix for a set of points, i.e. it calculates all the distances\n      between every point combination. But we do not stop there, we also offer a time-, weight- and route-matrix.\n      The weight-matrix can be used as raw input for e.g. a vehicle routing problem ([VRP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem))\n      and is more precise than a time- or distance-matrix. E.g. for bike routes the actual weight of a route (e.g. the \"beauty\")\n      is what you want to decide if a route is 'better' and not always the taken time or distance.\n\n      A simple illustration for a 3x3 matrix with identical from and to points:\n\n      -          |to_point1|to_point2|to_point3\n      :-----------|:--------|:--------|:--------\n      from_point1 |0        |1-\u003e2     | 1-\u003e3\n      from_point2 |2-\u003e1     |0        | 2-\u003e3\n      from_point3 |3-\u003e1     |3-\u003e2     | 0\n\n      A simple illustration for a 1x3 matrix with different start- and end-points:\n\n      -          | to_point1  | to_point2 | t_point3\n      :-----------|:-----------|:----------|:--------\n      from_pointA |A-\u003e1        |A-\u003e2       |A-\u003e3\n\n\n      For every route 1-\u003e2, 1-3, ... or A-\u003e1,A-\u003e2,A-\u003e3 you can return only the weight, the time and the distance.\n      To calculate full routes you can use the [Routing API](#tag/Routing-API).\n\n      ### Limits and Counts\n\n      The cost for one request depends on the number of locations and is documented [here](https://support.graphhopper.com/support/solutions/44000303787#what-is-one-credit).\n\n      One request should not exceed the Matrix API location limit, which depends on the subscription, see the\n      pricing tab in our dashboard.\n    name: Matrix API\n  - description: Everything about geocoding\n    name: Geocoding API\n  - description: Everything about isochrones\n    name: Isochrone API\n  - description: Everything about map matching aka \"snap to road\"\n    name: Map Matching API\n  - description: |\n      \n      ### Introduction\n\n      ![Cluster Example](./img/cluster-solution.jpg)\n\n      It solves the “capacity clustering problem” by assigning a set of customers to a given number of distinct groups (called clusters).\n      The API “clusters” by minimizing the total distance from each individual customer to its designated group median.\n      It can also consider minimum and maximum capacity restrictions for each group.\n\n      Clustering can be used in many practical applications.\n      For example, it can help to plan territories, i.e. territory optimization for field teams with large territories for field workers,\n      or to solve large vehicle routing problems (VRP).\n    name: Cluster API\npaths:\n  /cluster:\n    post:\n      description: |\n        \n        The Cluster endpoint is used with a POST request towards\n        `https://graphhopper.com/api/1/cluster?key=\u003cyour_key\u003e`.

Each provider has its own strenghts and might fit better for certain scenarios, so it's worth to compare the different providers.\n            To try it append the `provider`parameter to the URL like `\u0026provider=nominatim`,\n            the result structure should be identical in all cases - if not, please report this back to us.\n            Keep in mind that some providers do not support certain parameters or don't return some fields, for example `osm_id` and `osm_type` are not supported by every geocoding provider.\n            If you would like to use additional parameters of one of the providers, but it's not available for the GraphHopper Geocoding API, yet? Please contact us.\n\n            The credit costs can be different for all providers - see [here](https://support.graphhopper.com/support/solutions/articles/44000718211-what-is-one-credit-) for more information about it.\n\n            Currently, only the default provider and gisgraphy supports autocompletion of partial search strings.\n\n            All providers support normal \"forward\" geocoding and reverse geocoding via `reverse=true`.\n\n            #### Default (`provider=default`)\n\n            This provider returns results of our internal geocoding engine, as described above.\n            In addition to the above documented parameters the following parameters are possible:\n            * `bbox` - the expected format is `minLon,minLat,maxLon,maxLat`\n            * `osm_tag` - you can filter `key:value` or exclude places with certain OpenStreetMap tags `!key:value`. E.g. `osm_tag=tourism:museum` or just the key `osm_tag=tourism`. To exclude multiple tags you add multiple `osm_tag` parameters.\n\n            #### Nominatim (`provider=nominatim`)\n\n            The GraphHopper Directions API uses a commercially hosted Nominatim geocoder. You can try this provider [here](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/). The provider does **not** fall under the [restrictions](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/) of the Nominatim instance hosted by OpenStreetMap.\n\n            In addition to the above documented parameters Nominatim allows to use the following parameters, which can be used as documented [here](https://github.com/openstreetmap/Nominatim/blob/master/docs/api/Search.md#parameters):\n\n            * `viewbox` - the expected format is `minLon,minLat,maxLon,maxLat`\n            * `bounded` - If 1 and a viewbox is given, restrict the result to items contained within that viewbox. Default is 0.\n\n            #### Gisgraphy (`provider=gisgraphy`)\n\n            This provider returns results from the Gisgraphy geocoder which you can try [here](https://services.gisgraphy.com/static/leaflet/index.html).\n\n            **Limitations:** The `locale` parameter is not supported. Gisgraphy does not return OSM tags or an extent.\n\n            Gisgraphy has a special autocomplete API, which you can use by adding `autocomplete=true` (does not work with `reverse=true`). The autocomplete API is optimized on predicting text input, but returns less information.\n\n            In addition to the above documented parameters Gisgraphy allows to use the following parameters, which can be used as documented [here](https://www.gisgraphy.com/documentation/user-guide.php#geocodingservice):\n\n            * `radius` - radius in meters\n            * `country` - restrict search for the specified country. The value must be the ISO 3166 Alpha 2 code of the country.\n\n            #### NetToolKit (`provider=nettoolkit`)\n\n            This provider returns results from the NetToolKit provider which is specialized for US addresses and provides a wrapper around Nominatim for other addresses. You can try it [here](https://www.nettoolkit.com/geo/demo).\n\n            The following additional NetToolKit parameters are supported (read [here](https://www.nettoolkit.com/docs/geo/geocoding) for more details):\n            - `source`: User can choose which source provider to geocode the address, this value is \"NetToolKit\" by default\n            - `country_code`: an iso-3166-2 country code (e.g : US) filter the results to the specify country code\n\n            **Limitations:** NetToolKit does not support the `locale` parameter. NetToolKit does not return OSM tags (e.g. osm_id, osm_type, osm_value).\n\n            #### OpenCage Data (`provider=opencagedata`)\n\n            This provider returns results from the OpenCageData geocoder which you can try [here](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/demo).\n\n            In addition to the above documented parameters OpenCage Data allows to use the following parameters, which can be used as documented [here](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/api#forward-opt):\n\n            * countrycode - The country code is a two letter code as defined by the ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2 standard. E.g. gb for the United Kingdom, fr for France, us for United States. \n            * bounds - the expected format is `minLon,minLat,maxLon,maxLat`\n          in: query\n          name: provider\n          schema:\n            default: default\n            type: string\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/GeocodingResponse\"\n          description: An array found locations\n          headers:\n            X-RateLimit-Credits:\n              description: The credit costs for this request.

Read more at Wikipedia.\n\n        In the example screenshot above and demo you see the Map Matching API in action where the black line is the GPS track and the green one is matched result.\n\n        Most of the times, you can simply POST a GPX file, but some of the request parameters of the [Routing API](#tag/Routing-API) apply here, too.\n\n        ### API Clients and Examples\n        See the [clients](#section/API-Clients) section in the main documentation, and [live examples](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/examples/#map-matching).\n\n        ### Limits and Counts\n        The cost for one request depends on the number of GPS location and is documented [here](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/docs/FAQ/).\n\n        One request should not exceed the Map Matching API location limit depending on the package, see the pricing in our dashboard.\n      operationId: postGPX\n      parameters:\n        - description: Specify the precision of a point, in meter\n          in: query\n          name: gps_accuracy\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            type: integer\n        - description: Specify the vehicle profile like car\n          in: query\n          name: vehicle\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            type: string\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/RouteResponse\"\n          description: Routing Result\n          headers:\n            X-RateLimit-Credits:\n              description: The credit costs for this request.

If you deal with services then you need to use the id of your services in ids. To also consider sequences of the pickups and deliveries of your shipments, you need to use a special ID, i.e. use your shipment id plus the keyword `_pickup` or `_delivery`. If you want to place a service or shipment activity at the beginning of your route, use the special ID `start`. In turn, use `end` to place it at the end of the route.\n          example:\n            - pickup-1\n            - pickup-2\n          items:\n            type: string\n          type: array\n        type:\n          description: |+\n            Specifies the type of relation. It must be either of type `in_same_route`, `in_sequence` or `in_direct_sequence`.\n\n            `in_same_route`: As the name suggest, it enforces the specified services or shipments to be in the same route. It can be specified as follows:\n\n            ```json\n            {\n               \"type\": \"in_same_route\",\n               \"ids\": [\"serv_i_id\",\"serv_j_id\"]\n            }\n            ```\n\n            This enforces service i to be in the same route as service j no matter which vehicle will be employed. If a specific vehicle (driver) is required to conduct this, just add a `vehicle_id` like this:\n\n            ```\n            {\n               \"type\": \"in_same_route\",\n               \"ids\": [\"serv_i_id\",\"serv_j_id\"],\n               \"vehicle_id\": \"vehicle1\"\n            }\n            ```\n\n            This not only enforce service i and j to be in the same route, but also makes sure that both services are in the route of `vehicle1`.\n\n            *Tip*: This way initial loads and vehicle routes can be modelled. For example, if your vehicles are already on the road and new orders come in, then vehicles can still be rescheduled subject to the orders that have already been assigned to these vehicles.\n\n\n\n            `in_sequence`: This relation type enforces n jobs to be in sequence. It can be specified as\n\n            ```json\n            {\n               \"type\": \"in_sequence\",\n               \"ids\": [\"serv_i_id\",\"serv_j_id\"]\n            }\n            ```\n\n            which means that service j need to be in the same route as service i AND it needs to occur somewhere after service i. As described above if a specific vehicle needs to conduct this, just add `vehicle_id`.\n\n\n            `in_direct_sequence`: This enforces n services or shipments to be in direct sequence. It can be specified as\n\n            ```json\n            {\n               \"type\": \"in_direct_sequence\",\n               \"ids\": [\"serv_i_id\",\"serv_j_id\",\"serv_k_id\"]\n            }\n            ```\n\n            yielding service j to occur directly after service i, and service k to occur directly after service j i.e. in strong order. Again, a vehicle can be assigned a priority by adding a `vehicle_id` to the relation.\n\n\n            *Special IDs*:\n            If you look at the previous example and you want service i to be the first in the route, use the special ID `start` as follows:\n\n            ```json\n            {\n               \"type\": \"in_direct_sequence\",\n               \"ids\": [\"start\",\"serv_i_id\",\"serv_j_id\",\"serv_k_id\"]\n            }\n            ```\n\n            Latter enforces the direct sequence of i, j and k at the beginning of the route. If this sequence should be bound to the end of the route, use the special ID `end` like this:\n\n            ```json\n            {\n               \"type\": \"in_direct_sequence\",\n               \"ids\": [\"serv_i_id\",\"service_j_id\",\"serv_k_id\",\"end\"]\n            }\n            ```\n\n            If you deal with services then you need to use the 'id' of your services in the field 'ids'. To also consider sequences of the pickups and deliveries of your shipments, you need to use a special ID, i.e. use the shipment id plus the keyword `_pickup` or `_delivery`. For example, to ensure that the pickup and delivery of the shipment with the id 'my_shipment' are direct neighbors, you need the following specification:\n\n            ```\n            {\n               \"type\": \"in_direct_sequence\",\n               \"ids\": [\"my_ship_pickup\",\"my_ship_delivery\"]\n            }\n            ```\n\n          example: in_direct_sequence\n          type: string\n        vehicle_id:\n          description: Id of pre-assigned vehicle, i.e. the vehicle id that is determined to conduct the services and shipments in this relation.\n          example: driver-Peter\n          type: string\n      required:\n        - type\n        - ids\n      type: object\n    LineString:\n      properties:\n        coordinates:\n          description: |\n            A list of coordinate pairs or triples, `[lon,lat]` or `[lon,lat,elevation]`.\n          items:\n            items:\n              type: number\n            type: array\n          type: array\n        type:\n          type: string\n      type: object\n    MatrixRequest:\n      example:\n        from_point_hints:\n          - Copenhagen Street\n          - Richmond Avenue\n          - White Lion Street\n        from_points:\n          - - -0.11379003524780275\n            - 51.53664617804063\n          - - -0.10866165161132814\n            - 51.538621486960956\n          - - -0.11059284210205078\n            - 51.53245503603458\n        out_arrays:\n          - weights\n          - times\n          - distances\n        to_point_hints:\n          - Cannon\n          - Cornhill\n        to_points:\n          - - -0.09576559066772462\n            - 51.512882367963456\n          - - -0.08797645568847656\n            - 51.51317615367198\n        vehicle: car\n      properties:\n        fail_fast:\n          default: true\n          description: Specifies whether or not the matrix calculation should return with an error as soon as possible in case some points cannot be found or some points are not connected.

In case of one vehicle, switching from `min` to `min-max` should not have any impact.\n            If you have more than one vehicle, then the algorithm tries to constantly move stops from one vehicle to another such that\n            the completion time of longest vehicle route can be further reduced. For example, if you have one vehicle that takes 8 hours\n            to serve all customers, adding another vehicle (and using `min-max`) might halve the time to serve all customers to 4 hours. However,\n            this usually comes with higher transport costs.\n\n            If you want to minimize `vehicles` first and, second, `completion_time`, you can also combine different objectives like this:\n\n            ```json\n            \"objectives\" : [\n               {\n                  \"type\": \"min\",\n                  \"value\": \"vehicles\"\n               },\n               {\n                  \"type\": \"min\",\n                  \"value\": \"completion_time\"\n               }\n            ]\n            ```\n\n            If you want to balance activities or the number of stops among all employed drivers, you need to specify it as follows:\n\n            ```json\n            \"objectives\" : [\n               {\n                  \"type\": \"min-max\",\n                  \"value\": \"completion_time\"\n               },\n               {\n                  \"type\": \"min-max\",\n                  \"value\": \"activities\"\n               }\n            ]\n            ```\n          enum:\n            - min\n            - min-max\n          type: string\n        value:\n          default: transport_time\n          description: |\n            The value of the objective function.\n            The objective value `transport_time` solely considers the time\n            your drivers spend on the road, i.e. transport time. In contrary to `transport_time`, `completion_time` also takes waiting times at customer sites into account.\n            The `completion_time` of a route is defined as the time from starting to ending the route,\n            i.e. the route's transport time, the sum of waiting times plus the sum of activity durations.\n            Note that choosing `transport_time` or `completion_time` only makes a difference if you specified time windows for your services/shipments since only in\n            scenarios with time windows waiting times can occur.\n            The objective value `vehicles` can only be used along with `min` and minimizes vehicles.\n          enum:\n            -
