Where\n        querying with dates requires providing valid values for the `start` and\n        `end` parameters. Requests without these values will be considered a\n        query without dates.\n\n\n        **Querying without dates:**\n\n\n        When you query without dates, the search result will include all\n        properties that match your request. Including all content that is\n        associated with those properties. However you will find that the `rates`\n        attribute for each room will always be empty.\n\n\n        **Querying with dates:**\n\n\n        When you query with dates, the search result will include all properties\n        that match your request, including all content that is associated with\n        those properties. However, hotels with no available rooms will be\n        filtered out of the result. For the remaining hotels all rooms will be\n        represented within the result regardless of whether they are available.\n        Rooms which do not have available prices for the provided dates will\n        appear with an empty `rates` array.\n\n\n        For rooms where there are available prices the `rates` array will\n        include both the public rates of the hotel, along with prices that come\n        from deals in which you are participating.

They typically consist of\n        a combination of restrictiveness in case of cancellations or changes,\n        the time they're bookable, minimum or maximum length of stay\n        restrictions (e.g. week-long bookings), included components like\n        breakfast or dinner and/or the conditions under which the room can be\n        sold (e.g. private rates that can only be offered and sold to a closed\n        user group behind login).\n\n\n        Examples of rate plans:\n\n\n        * Non-refundable room rate that includes breakfast\n\n        * Room-only rate with free cancellation up to 14 days before arrival\n\n\n        For each such rate plan this endpoint returns the room types it's\n        available for, alongside prices for each date and occupancy that can be\n        sold – or the information that the room isn't available (closed) for a\n        certain date.\n\n\n        For the vast majority of our customers, availability searches using the\n        [List all\n        hotels](https://docs.impala.travel/docs/booking-api/spec/openapi.seller.yaml/paths/~1hotels/get)\n        endpoint are the best choice. It accepts the dates your guest is looking\n        for and provides the rates to display.\n\n\n        This endpoint can help augment this for two additional use cases:\n\n\n        This endpoint allows you to query rate prices for all future dates in\n        one go, making it a great choice to feed availability information and\n        prices into your own system or displaying a rate calender to guide your\n        guests to gain an overview of future availability and prices.\n      parameters:\n        -

Its value should be a comma-separated list\n        of hotel ids (e.g. `?hotelIds={hotelId},{hotelId}`).\n\n\n        You can specify the **sorting order** in which hotels are returned:\n\n        * This is done by using the `sortBy` query parameter.\n\n        * Results can be sorted by `name` alphabetically, star `rating` and\n        `distance_m` (in meters from the specified latitude/longitude location).\n\n        * The parameter allows for a comma-separated list of arguments with\n        optional `:asc` (ascending, the default if the modifier is omitted) and\n        `:desc` (descending) modifiers.\n\n\n        If no hotels match your filter criteria, an empty array will be\n        returned.\n      parameters:\n        - name: name[eq]\n          in: query\n          schema:\n            type: string\n          description: \u003e-\n            Allows for filtering based on the property name.

Any new rates selected must be for the same hotel as the\n        original booking.\n\n\n        A booking cannot be updated on or after the check in day of the original\n        or new stay.\n\n\n        In addition, we require you do supply a\n        `updateBookingVersionAtTimestamp` field with the `updatedAt` timestamp\n        of the booking. You can find this value by looking up the booking via\n        the [Retrieve a\n        booking](https://docs.impala.travel/docs/booking-api/spec/openapi.seller.yaml/paths/~1bookings~1%7BbookingId%7D/get)\n        endpoint. This is to avoid race conditions where another update might\n        have happened since the last time you have checked for the current\n        details of this booking.\n\n\n        The `status` of this booking will switch back to `PENDING` until we have\n        submitted and confirmed the new details with the hotel.\n\n\n        \u003c!-- theme: warning --\u003e\n\n\n        \u003e **This request might take up to 20 seconds to load.** While we work to\n        return a response to your request within milliseconds in most cases,\n        some bookings require us to re-verify current pricing in real-time and\n        doing so might take up to 20 seconds.

Paid via you**\n\n\n        If you have provided a credit card on the dashboard then **Impala will\n        send the booking to the hotel immediately**. We'll ensure payment is\n        taken care of before your guest arrives at the hotel.\n\n\n        * Your guest needs to be **paying you** the rate specified in\n        `retailRate` (as listed in the [Retrieve a\n        hotel](https://docs.impala.travel/docs/booking-api/spec/openapi.seller.yaml/paths/~1hotels~1%7BhotelId%7D/get)\n        response) before you submit this request.\n\n        * Once your request is received and the booking is confirmed, **Impala\n        will charge you** as the seller this `retailRate` minus the\n        `sellerCommissionPercentage` (which is the affiliate commission you get\n        to keep). We'll use the business credit card you've added to your\n        account as payment method for this.\n\n        * The difference between the amount you charge your guest (`retailRate`,\n        e.g. 200 €) and what Impala charges you (`retailRate` minus\n        `sellerCommissionPercentage`, e.g. 200 €) is your commission (in this\n        example: 20 €) to keep.\n\n\n        You can find more information on how money flows between your guest and\n        you, and you and Impala, [in this\n        article](https://impala.stoplight.io/docs/booking-api/branches/v1.003/docs/good-to-know/payments-and-commissions.md)\n\n\n        **2. Payment via the guest**\n\n\n        If you are set-up to collect payment details, then you can forward these\n        to Impala through the`/payments` endpoint. If you are set up for this\n        flow then:\n\n\n        * We will create the booking in a `PENDING` state\n\n        * We will return a `paymentBearerToken` that you must use to authorise\n        with the /payments endpoint. This will be valid for **5 minutes** after\n        which point the booking will be marked as abandoned.\n\n        * We require you to send a payment auth callback url as part of the\n        booking request. This is used in the event that further authorisation is\n        required by the paying guests bank. You will need to redirect the guest\n        to a URL passed back by the bank. Upon completion they will redirect the\n        user back to the URL you sent in the booking request.\n\n\n        In order to use this endpoint, you must confirm your payment flow and\n        API keys with Impala. Please contact support@impala.travel to configure\n        your flow.\n\n\n        \u003c!-- theme: warning --\u003e\n\n\n        \u003e **This request might take up to 20 seconds to load.** While we work to\n        return a response to your request within milliseconds in most cases,\n        some bookings require us to re-verify current pricing in real-time and\n        doing so might take up to 20 seconds. Please make sure your app handles\n        this waiting state appropriately.\n      requestBody:\n        description: \u003e-\n          payload on create booking\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n              title: CreateBookingPayload\n              description: \u003e- \n                payload on booking creation\n              properties:\n                start:\n                  type: string\n                end:\n                  type: string\n                dealId:\n                  type: string\n                bookingContact:\n                  type: object\n                  $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Person\"\n                notes:\n                  type: object\n                  properties: \n                    fromGuest: \n                      type: string\n                    fromSeller:\n                      type: string\n                rooms:\n                  type: array\n                  title: BookingRoomDataPerRoom\n                  items:  \n                    type: object\n                    properties:\n                      rateId: \n                        type: number\n                      adults: \n                        type: number\n                      notes: \n                        type: object\n                        properties: \n                          fromGuest:\n                            type: string \n                          fromSeller:\n                            type: string\n                paymentType: \n                  type: string\n              example:\n                start: '2019-08-24'\n                end: '2019-08-24'\n                bookingContact:\n                  firstName: Jocelín\n                  lastName: Carreón Sample\n                  email: jocelin.carreon.crespo@example.com\n                rooms:\n                  -
