In addition to the values passed here, a few other values are automatically injected into the environment. These cannot be hidden or overwritten. `GOOGLE_PIPELINE_FAILED` will be set to \"1\" if the pipeline failed because an action has exited with a non-zero status (and did not have the `IGNORE_EXIT_STATUS` flag set). This can be used to determine if additional debug or logging actions should execute. `GOOGLE_LAST_EXIT_STATUS` will be set to the exit status of the last non-background action that executed. This can be used by workflow engine authors to determine whether an individual action has succeeded or failed.\n          type: object\n        flags:\n          description: The set of flags to apply to this action.\n          items:\n            enum:\n              - FLAG_UNSPECIFIED\n              - IGNORE_EXIT_STATUS\n              - RUN_IN_BACKGROUND\n              - ALWAYS_RUN\n              - ENABLE_FUSE\n              - PUBLISH_EXPOSED_PORTS\n              - DISABLE_IMAGE_PREFETCH\n              - DISABLE_STANDARD_ERROR_CAPTURE\n              - BLOCK_EXTERNAL_NETWORK\n            enumDescriptions:\n              - Unspecified flag.\n              - Normally, a non-zero exit status causes the pipeline to fail. This flag allows execution of other actions to continue instead.\n              - This flag allows an action to continue running in the background while executing subsequent actions. This is useful to provide services to other actions (or to provide debugging support tools like SSH servers).\n              - By default, after an action fails, no further actions are run. This flag indicates that this action must be run even if the pipeline has already failed. This is useful for actions that copy output files off of the VM or for debugging. Note that no actions will be run if image prefetching fails.\n              - Enable access to the FUSE device for this action. Filesystems can then be mounted into disks shared with other actions. The other actions do not need the `ENABLE_FUSE` flag to access the mounted filesystem. This has the effect of causing the container to be executed with `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` and exposes `/dev/fuse` to the container, so use it only for containers you trust.\n              - Exposes all ports specified by `EXPOSE` statements in the container. To discover the host side port numbers, consult the `ACTION_STARTED` event in the operation metadata.\n              - All container images are typically downloaded before any actions are executed. This helps prevent typos in URIs or issues like lack of disk space from wasting large amounts of compute resources. If set, this flag prevents the worker from downloading the image until just before the action is executed.\n              - A small portion of the container's standard error stream is typically captured and returned inside the `ContainerStoppedEvent`. Setting this flag disables this functionality.\n              - Prevents the container from accessing the external network.\n            type: string\n          type: array\n        imageUri:\n          description: Required.

If multiple actions reference the same image, it is only pulled once, ensuring that the same image is used for all actions in a single pipeline. The image URI can be either a complete host and image specification (e.g., quay.io/biocontainers/samtools), a library and image name (e.g., google/cloud-sdk) or a bare image name ('bash') to pull from the default library. No schema is required in any of these cases. If the specified image is not public, the service account specified for the Virtual Machine must have access to pull the images from GCR, or appropriate credentials must be specified in the google.genomics.v2alpha1.Action.credentials field.\n          type: string\n        labels:\n          additionalProperties:\n            type: string\n          description: Labels to associate with the action.

(b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level. For example, when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence. (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. For example, if an \"rmdir\" fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should be returned since the client should not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory.

E.g., seeking or reading past end-of-file. Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this error indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file system will generate `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if asked to read at an offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate `OUT_OF_RANGE` if asked to read from an offset past the current file size. There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`. We recommend using `OUT_OF_RANGE` (the more specific error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through a space can easily look for an `OUT_OF_RANGE` error to detect when they are done.
