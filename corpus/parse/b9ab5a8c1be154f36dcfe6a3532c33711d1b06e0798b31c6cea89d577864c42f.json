These requests are described in\n    [Member](/#tag/Member) and [Migration](/#tag/Migration) sections.\n\n\n    Seed is a unique piece of information generated by a node that:\n\n\n    * has a short lifespan;\n\n    * expires upon first use;\n\n    * protects from request fakes, i.e., duplicate requests sent by a malicious\n    party sniffing the traffic. This ensures that a single funds transfer\n    request can only be sent once by the owner of the funds.\n\n\n    Since the seed is generated by a node, it must be validated by the same\n    node. Therefore, each subsequent contract request containing the seed must\n    be sent to the node that generated it.\n\n\n    To call a smart contract's method, go through the following steps:\n\n\n    1. Send a [getSeed](/#operation/get-seed) information request and receive\n    the seed.\n\n       For example, the `getSeed` request is as follows:\n\n       ```json\n       {\n           \"jsonprc\": \"2.0\",\n           \"id\": 1,\n           \"method\": \"node.getSeed\"\n       }\n       ```\n\n       And the response is:\n\n       ```json\n       {\n         \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n         \"id\": 1,\n         \"result\": {\n         \"seed\": \"\u003cseed\u003e\"\n         }\n       }\n       ```\n\n    2. Form and sign a contract request (e.g.,\n    [member.create](/#operation/member-create)) with the acquired seed.\n\n       Every contract request is to contain the Digest and Signature HTTP headers. For example:\n\n       ```\n       POST /\u003cendpoint\u003e HTTP/1.1\n       Host: \u003cHost\u003e\n       Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2019 20:51:35 GMT\n       Content-Type: application/json\n       Digest: SHA-256=\u003chashString\u003e\n       Signature: keyId=\"public-key\", algorithm=\"ecdsa\", headers=\"digest\", signature=\u003csignatureString\u003e\n\n       { \u003cpayload\u003e }\n       ```\n\n       And the contract request's `\u003cpayload\u003e` with the seed may be as follows:\n\n       ```json\n       {\n         \"jsonprc\": \"2.0\",\n         \"id\": 2,\n         \"method\": \"contract.call\",\n         \"params\": {\n           \"seed\": \"\u003cseed\u003e\",\n           \"callSite\": \"member.create\",\n           \"callParams\": {},\n           \"publicKey\": \"\u003cpubicKey\u003e\"\n         }\n       }\n       ```\n\n       In this example:\n\n       * [Digest HTTP header](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3230#section-4.3.2) contains the Base64 `\u003chashString\u003e` with the SHA-256 hash of the payload's bytes.\n\n       * [Signature HTTP header](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-cavage-http-signatures-11.html#sig-header) contains the Base64 `\u003csignatureString\u003e` with the ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) signature in the [ASN.1 DER format](https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e\u0026id=T-REC-X.690-201508-I!!PDF-E\u0026type=items). Signed are the bytes of the hash from the Digest header.\n\n       * `\u003cpubicKey\u003e` contains a Base64 string with the ECDSA public key in [PEM format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1421).\n\n       * `\u003cseed\u003e` contains the seed acquired in the previous `getSeed` request.\n\n       * `\"method\": \"contract.call\"` designates a call to a contract's method.\n\n       * `callSite` is the contract method's call point, in this case, `member.create`.\n\n       * `callParams` are the contract method's parameters.\n\n    3. Send the formed and signed contract request to the node that generated\n    the seed.\n\n       Insolar responds to contract requests with:\n\n       ```json\n       {\n         \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n         \"id\": 2,\n         \"result\": {\n         \"callResult\": {\n            \"reference\": \u003creferenceString\u003e\n            },\n         \"requestReference\": \u003crequestReferenceString\u003e,\n         \"traceID\": \u003ctraceIDString\u003e\n         }\n       }\n       ```\n       Where `\"callResult\"` contains the result of the contract's method execution. In this case, it is a reference to a newly created member object since the `\"callSite\"` of the request is `\"member.create\"`.\n\n    # Errors\n\n\n    Insolar follows the JSON RPC API conventions on [error\n    codes](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#error_object), with values:\n\n    * `-31000`-`-31999` reserved for the Insolar network;\n\n    * `-200`-`-299` reserved for the wallet application;\n\n    * the rest available for other contracts.\n\n\n    Below is the list of Insolar Platform errors.\n\n\n    | **Code** | **Message**                                                 |\n\n    |----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n    | -31700   | Parsing error on the server side: received an invalid JSON. |\n\n    | -31600   | The JSON received is not a valid request payload.           |\n\n    | -31601   | Method does not exist / is not available.                   |\n\n    | -31602   | Invalid method parameter(s).                                |\n\n    | -31603   | Internal Platform error.                                    |\n\n    | -31106   | Request's timeout has expired.                              |\n\n    | -31401   | Action is not authorized.                                   |\n\n    | -31429   | Service unavailable, try again later.                       |\n\n    | -31103   | Execution error.                                            |\n\n\n    # Versioning\n\n\n    The API is usually changed in each release of Insolar, so API calls are\n    versioned to ensure that clients do not break.\n\n\n    To lock to an API version, prefix the URL with the version number. For\n    example, calling `/api/rpc` is the same as calling `/v0.0.1/api/rpc`.\n\n\n    Insolar releases in the near future will support this version of the API, so\n    your client will continue to work even if it is talking to a newer API.\n\n\n    API versions do not have correlations to Insolar Platform versions.\nservers:\n  - url: 'https://wallet-api.insolar.io'\n    description: Production server\npaths:\n  '/api/rpc#node.getSeed':\n    post:\n      summary: node.getSeed\n      description: \u003e\n\n        Gets a new seed (random byte range).\n\n\n        Each signed contract request has to contain a new seed in its body. Seed\n        is a unique piece of information generated by a node that:\n\n         * has a short lifespan;\n         * expires upon first use;\n         * protects from request fakes, i.e., duplicate requests sent by a malicious party sniffing the traffic. This ensures that a single funds transfer request can only be sent once by the owner of the funds.\n\n        Since the seed is generated by a node, it must be validated by the same\n        node.

Seed\n        is a unique piece of information generated by a node that:\n\n         * has a short lifespan;\n         * expires upon first use;\n         * protects from request fakes, i.e., duplicate requests sent by a malicious party sniffing the traffic. This ensures that a single funds transfer request can only be sent once by the owner of the funds.\n\n        Since the seed is generated by a node, it must be validated by the same\n        node. Therefore, each subsequent contract request containing the seed\n        must be sent to the node that generated it.\n      operationId: internal-get-seed\n      tags:\n        - Internal\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              allOf:\n                -
