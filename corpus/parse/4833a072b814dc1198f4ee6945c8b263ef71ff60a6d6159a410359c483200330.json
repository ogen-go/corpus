Below is the list of different filters with examples:\n              - **createdBy** : Filter by the user's identifier who created the content. Example: `createdBy:000000000000968B`.\n              - **createdBefore** : Filter by the content objects created before the given timestamp(in milliseconds). Example: `createdBefore:1457997222`.\n              - **createdAfter** : Filter by the content objects created after the given timestamp(in milliseconds). Example: `createdAfter:1457997111`.\n              - **modifiedBefore** : Filter by the content objects modified before the given timestamp(in milliseconds). Example: `modifiedBefore:1457997222`.\n              - **modifiedAfter** : Filter by the content objects modified after the given timestamp(in milliseconds). Example: `modifiedAfter:1457997111`.\n              - **type** : Filter by the type of the content object. Example: `type:folder`.\n              - **monitorStatus** : Filter by the status of the monitor: Normal, Critical, Warning, MissingData, Disabled, AllTriggered. Example: `monitorStatus:Normal`.\n\n            You can also use multiple filters in one query. For example to search for all content objects created by user with identifier 000000000000968B with creation timestamp after 1457997222 containing the text Test, the query would look like:\n\n              `createdBy:000000000000968B createdAfter:1457997222 Test`\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n          example: createdBy:000000000000968B Test\n        - name: limit\n          in: query\n          description: Maximum number of items you want in the response.\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            type: integer\n            format: int32\n            default: 100\n          example: 10\n        - name: offset\n          in: query\n          description: The position or row from where to start the search operation.\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            type: integer\n            format: int32\n            default: 0\n          example: 5\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: List of folders and monitors matching the search query.\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ListMonitorsLibraryItemWithPath'\n        default:\n          description: Operation failed with an error.\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse'\n  /v1/monitors/{id}:\n    get:\n      tags:\n        - monitorsLibraryManagement\n      summary: Get a monitor or folder.\n      description: Get a monitor or folder from the monitors library.\n      operationId: monitorsReadById\n      parameters:\n        - name: id\n          in: path\n          description: Identifier of the monitor or folder to read.\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Requested monitor or folder.\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/MonitorsLibraryBaseResponse'\n        default:\n          description: Operation failed with an error.\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse'\n    put:\n      tags:\n        - monitorsLibraryManagement\n      summary: |\n        Update a monitor or folder.\n      description: Update a monitor or folder in the monitors library.\n      operationId: monitorsUpdateById\n      parameters:\n        - name: id\n          in: path\n          description: Identifier of the monitor or folder to update.\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n      requestBody:\n        description: The monitor or folder to update.

Sumo Logic has several deployments that are assigned depending on the geographic location and the date an account is created. For details determining your account's deployment see [API endpoints](https://help.sumologic.com/?cid=3011).\n      The [Content Import API](#operation/beginAsyncImport) can be used to create or update a Search, Scheduled Search, or Dashboard. Here is an example creating a Scheduled Search:\n      1. Get the identifier of your `Personal` folder.\n        ```bash\n        curl -X GET -u \"\u003caccessId\u003e:\u003caccessKey\u003e\" https://api.sumologic.com/api/v2/content/folders/personal\n        ```\n\n        Find the identifier of your `Personal` folder in the response.\n        ```json\n        {\n            ...\n            \"id\": \"0000000006A2E86F\", \u003c----\n            \"name\": \"Personal\",\n            \"itemType\": \"Folder\",\n            ...\n        }\n        ```\n\n        You can use [getFolder](#operation/getFolder), [getAdminRecommededFolder](#operation/getAdminRecommendedFolderAsync),\n        or [getGlobalFolder](#operation/getGlobalFolderAsync) endpoints to traverse the content tree and find the identifier of any\n        folder you want to manage.\n\n      2. Use the [Content Import API](#operation/beginAsyncImport) to create a new Scheduled Search inside your\n        `Personal` folder.\n        ```bash\n        curl -X POST -u \"\u003caccessId\u003e:\u003caccessKey\u003e\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d @search.json https://api.sumologic.com/api/v2/content/folders/0000000006A2E86F/import\n        ```\n\n        The data file `search.json` in the above command has the following `SavedSearchWithScheduleSyncDefinition` object.\n        ```json\n        // file: search.json\n        {\n            \"type\": \"SavedSearchWithScheduleSyncDefinition\",\n            \"name\": \"demo-scheduled-search\",\n            \"description\": \"Runs every hour with timerange of 15m and sends email notifications\",\n            \"search\": {\n                \"queryText\": \"\\\"error\\\" and \\\"warn\\\"\",\n                \"defaultTimeRange\": \"-15m\",\n                \"byReceiptTime\": false,\n                \"viewName\": \"\",\n                \"viewStartTime\": null,\n                \"queryParameters\": []\n            },\n            \"searchSchedule\": {\n                \"cronExpression\": \"0 0/15 * * * ? *\",\n                \"displayableTimeRange\": \"-15m\",\n                \"parseableTimeRange\": {\n                    \"from\": {\n                        \"relativeTime\": \"-15m\",\n                        \"type\": \"RelativeTimeRangeBoundary\"\n                    },\n                    \"to\": null,\n                    \"type\": \"BeginBoundedTimeRange\"\n                },\n                \"timeZone\": \"America/Los_Angeles\",\n                \"threshold\": null,\n                \"notification\": {\n                    \"taskType\": \"EmailSearchNotificationSyncDefinition\",\n                    \"toList\": [\n                        \"ops@acme.org\"\n                    ],\n                    \"subjectTemplate\": \"Search Results: {{SearchName}}\",\n                    \"includeQuery\": true,\n                    \"includeResultSet\": true,\n                    \"includeHistogram\": true,\n                    \"includeCsvAttachment\": false\n                },\n                \"muteErrorEmails\": false,\n                \"scheduleType\": \"1Hour\",\n                \"parameters\": []\n            }\n        }\n        ```\n\n        The response of above request will have the job identifier that you can use to track the status of the import job.\n        ```json\n        {\n            \"id\": \"74DC17FA765C7443\"\n        }\n        ```\n\n      3. Use the job identifier from the import request to get the [status](#operation/getAsyncImportStatus) of the\n        import job.\n        ```bash\n        curl -X GET -u \"\u003caccessId\u003e:\u003caccessKey\u003e\" https://api.sumologic.com/api/v2/content/folders/0000000006A2E86F/import/74DC17FA765C7443/status\n        ```\n\n        If you are importing a large item, you might have to wait for the import job to finish. The following is an\n        example response from a completed job.\n        ```json\n        {\n            \"status\": \"Success\",\n            \"statusMessage\": null,\n            \"error\": null\n        }\n        ```\n    x-displayName: Content\n  - name: contentPermissions\n    description: |\n      Content permissions API.\n\n      You can share your folders, searches, and dashboards with specific users or roles.
