The overarching concept educations is not found in the in the end points of the API. The smaller concepts of programOffering, courseOffering and conceptOffering are all found in the offering endpoint. The different types of association can all be found in the association endpoint.\n\n    The program relations object is not found as a separate endpoint but relations between programs can be found within the program endpoint by expanding that endpoint.\n\n    Information about earlier meetings and presentations can be found <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/open-education-api/notulen\">here</a>\n\n    Information on the EDU-API model that was also used for this api is shown <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"eduapi.png\">here</a>\n\n\n\n  x-logo:\n    url: ../logo.png\n\ntags:\n  - name: service metadata\n    description: The service API provides additional metadata needed to make the OOAPI fit for this organization.\n  - name: academic sessions\n    description: The academic sessions API provides information about the different time periods a program can be offered.\n  - name: associations\n    description: The associations API provides information about the association between an offering and a person (e.g. students, lecturers, etc).\n  - name: buildings\n    description: The building API provides a building that is currently used by the organization.
