The PCF shall not use the value UNSPECIFIED in filters created by the network in NW-initiated procedures. The PCF shall only include the value UNSPECIFIED in filters in UE-initiated procedures if the same value is received from the SMF.\n    N2InformationClass:\n      anyOf:\n      - type: string\n        enum:\n          - SM\n          - NRPPa\n          - PWS\n          - PWS-BCAL\n          - PWS-RF\n          - RAN\n      - type: string\n    N1MessageClass:\n      anyOf:\n      - type: string\n        enum:\n          - 5GMM\n          - SM\n          - LPP\n          - SMS\n          - UPDP\n      - type: string\n    ChargingInformation:\n      type: object\n      properties:\n        primaryChfAddress:\n          $ref: 'TS29571_CommonData.yaml#/components/schemas/Uri'\n        secondaryChfAddress:\n          $ref: 'TS29571_CommonData.yaml#/components/schemas/Uri'\n      required:\n        - primaryChfAddress\n        - secondaryChfAddress\n    FinalUnitAction:\n      anyOf:\n        - type: string\n          enum:\n            - TERMINATE\n            - REDIRECT\n            - RESTRICT_ACCESS\n        - type: string\n    NgRanTargetId:\n      type: object\n      properties:\n        ranNodeId:\n          $ref: 'TS29571_CommonData.yaml#/components/schemas/GlobalRanNodeId'\n        tai:\n          $ref: 'TS29571_CommonData.yaml#/components/schemas/Tai'\n      required:\n        - ranNodeId\n        - tai\n#\n# HTTP responses\n#\n  responses:\n    '400':\n      description: Bad request\n      content:\n        application/problem+json:\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetails'\n    '401':\n      description: Unauthorized\n      content:\n        application/problem+json:\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetails'\n    '403':\n      description: Forbidden\n      content:\n        application/problem+json:\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetails'\n    '404':\n      description: Not Found\n      content:\n        application/problem+json:\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetails'\n    '406':\n      description: Not Acceptable\n      content:\n        application/problem+json:\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetails'\n    '409':\n      description: Conflict\n      content:\n        application/problem+json:\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetails'\n    '411':\n      description: Length Required\n      content:\n        application/problem+json:\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetails'\n    '412':\n      description: Precondition Failed\n      content:\n        application/problem+json:\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetails'\n    '413':\n      description: Payload Too Large\n      content:\n        application/problem+json:\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetails'\n    '414':\n      description: URI Too Long\n      content:\n        application/problem+json:\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetails'\n    '415':\n      description: Unsupported Media Type\n      content:\n        application/problem+json:\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetails'\n    '429':\n      description: Too Many Requests\n      content:\n        application/problem+json:\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetails'\n    '500':\n      description: Internal Server Error\n      content:\n        application/problem+json:\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetails'\n    '503':\n      description: Service Unavailable\n      content:\n        application/problem+json:\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetails'\n    default:\n      description: Generic Error\n",
