For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.\n\n\n            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.\n\n\n            Filters are immutable and non-expiring.

Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure).

Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.\n\n\n            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.\n\n\n            Filters are immutable and non-expiring.

Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure).

Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter.

Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form.

Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).\n\n\n            #Safety\n\n\n            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.\n\n\n            #Built In Filters\n\n\n            The following filters are built in:\n\n\n            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).\n\n            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields\n\n            none, which is empty\n\n            total, which includes just .total\n\n\n            #Compatibility with V1.x\n\n\n            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in.

Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter.

Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.\n\n\n            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.\n\n\n            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.\n\n\n            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).\n\n\n            #Safety\n\n\n            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form.

Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.\n\n\n            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.\n\n\n            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.\n\n\n            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).\n\n\n            #Safety\n\n\n            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.\n\n\n            #Built In Filters\n\n\n            The following filters are built in:\n\n\n            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).\n\n            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields\n\n            none, which is empty\n\n            total, which includes just .total\n\n\n            #Compatibility with V1.x\n\n\n            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.\n          in: query\n          name: filter\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: \u003e\n            All API responses are JSON, we do support JSONP with the callback\n            query parameter.\n          in: query\n          name: callback\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: \u003e\n            Each of these methods operates on a single site at a time,\n            identified by the site parameter.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.\n\n\n            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.\n\n\n            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.\n\n\n            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).\n\n\n            #Safety\n\n\n            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.\n\n\n            #Built In Filters\n\n\n            The following filters are built in:\n\n\n            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).\n\n            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields\n\n            none, which is empty\n\n            total, which includes just .total\n\n\n            #Compatibility with V1.x\n\n\n            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.\n\n\n            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.\n\n\n            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.\n\n\n            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).\n\n\n            #Safety\n\n\n            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.\n\n\n            #Built In Filters\n\n\n            The following filters are built in:\n\n\n            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).\n\n            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields\n\n            none, which is empty\n\n            total, which includes just .total\n\n\n            #Compatibility with V1.x\n\n\n            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in.

Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...).

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.\n\n\n            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.\n\n\n            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.\n\n\n            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure).

Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.\n\n\n            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.\n\n\n            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.\n\n\n            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).\n\n\n            #Safety\n\n\n            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.\n\n\n            #Built In Filters\n\n\n            The following filters are built in:\n\n\n            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).\n\n            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields\n\n            none, which is empty\n\n            total, which includes just .total\n\n\n            #Compatibility with V1.x\n\n\n            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.\n\n\n            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.\n\n\n            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.\n\n\n            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).\n\n\n            #Safety\n\n\n            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.\n\n\n            #Built In Filters\n\n\n            The following filters are built in:\n\n\n            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).\n\n            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields\n\n            none, which is empty\n\n            total, which includes just .total\n\n\n            #Compatibility with V1.x\n\n\n            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in.

With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).\n\n\n            #Safety\n\n\n            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.\n\n\n            #Built In Filters\n\n\n            The following filters are built in:\n\n\n            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).\n\n            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields\n\n            none, which is empty\n\n            total, which includes just .total\n\n\n            #Compatibility with V1.x\n\n\n            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in.

Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth.

Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter.

Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.\n\n\n            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.\n\n\n            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.\n\n\n            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure).

Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter.

Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form.

Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form.

Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.\n\n\n            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.\n\n\n            Filters are immutable and non-expiring.

Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.\n\n\n            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.\n\n\n            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.\n\n\n            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).\n\n\n            #Safety\n\n\n            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.\n\n\n            #Built In Filters\n\n\n            The following filters are built in:\n\n\n            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).\n\n            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields\n\n            none, which is empty\n\n            total, which includes just .total\n\n\n            #Compatibility with V1.x\n\n\n            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in.

That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter.

Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.\n\n\n            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.\n\n\n            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.\n\n\n            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).\n\n\n            #Safety\n\n\n            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.\n\n\n            #Built In Filters\n\n\n            The following filters are built in:\n\n\n            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).\n\n            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields\n\n            none, which is empty\n\n            total, which includes just .total\n\n\n            #Compatibility with V1.x\n\n\n            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.\n\n\n            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.\n\n\n            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.\n\n\n            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).\n\n\n            #Safety\n\n\n            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.\n\n\n            #Built In Filters\n\n\n            The following filters are built in:\n\n\n            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).\n\n            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields\n\n            none, which is empty\n\n            total, which includes just .total\n\n\n            #Compatibility with V1.x\n\n\n            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0.

That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter.

Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter.

Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.\n\n\n            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.\n\n\n            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.\n\n\n            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).\n\n\n            #Safety\n\n\n            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.\n\n\n            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.\n\n\n            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.\n\n\n            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).\n\n\n            #Safety\n\n\n            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form.

Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.\n\n\n            #Built In Filters\n\n\n            The following filters are built in:\n\n\n            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).\n\n            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields\n\n            none, which is empty\n\n            total, which includes just .total\n\n\n            #Compatibility with V1.x\n\n\n            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.\n\n\n            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.\n\n\n            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.\n\n\n            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).\n\n\n            #Safety\n\n\n            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form.

Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.\n\n\n            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.\n\n\n            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.\n\n\n            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).\n\n\n            #Safety\n\n\n            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.\n\n\n            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.\n\n\n            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.\n\n\n            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).\n\n\n            #Safety\n\n\n            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form.

Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).\n\n\n            #Safety\n\n\n            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.\n\n\n            #Built In Filters\n\n\n            The following filters are built in:\n\n\n            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).\n\n            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields\n\n            none, which is empty\n\n            total, which includes just .total\n\n\n            #Compatibility with V1.x\n\n\n            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in.

Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).\n\n\n            #Safety\n\n\n            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.\n\n\n            Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).\n\n\n            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.\n\n\n            #Built In Filters\n\n\n            The following filters are built in:\n\n\n            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).\n\n            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields\n\n            none, which is empty\n\n            total, which includes just .total\n\n\n            #Compatibility with V1.x\n\n\n            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.\n          in: query\n          name: filter\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: \u003e\n            All API responses are JSON, we do support JSONP with the callback\n            query parameter.\n          in: query\n          name: callback\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: \u003e\n            Each of these methods operates on a single site at a time,\n            identified by the site parameter.

There are two\n        flows, an explicit grant for server side applications and an implicit\n        one for pure browser based ones.\n\n\n        #The explicit OAuth 2.0 flow consists of the following steps:\n\n        1. Send a user to https://stackexchange.com/oauth, with these query string parameters\n\n        - client_id\n\n        - scope\n\n        - redirect_uri - must be under an apps registered domain\n\n        - state - optional\n\n        2. The user approves your app\n\n        3. The user is redirected to redirect_uri, with these query string parameters\n\n        - code\n\n        - state - optional, only returned if provided in the first step\n\n        4. POST (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) the following parameters to https://stackexchange.com/oauth/access_token\n\n        - client_id\n\n        - client_secret\n\n        - code - from the previous step\n\n        - redirect_uri - must be the same as the provided in the first step\n\n        This request is responded to with either an error (HTTP status code 400) or an access token of the form access_token=...\u0026expires=1234. expires will only be set if scope does not include no_expiry, the use of which is strongly advised against unless your app truly needs perpetual access.\n\n\n        #The implicit OAuth 2.0 flow consists of the following steps:\n\n\n        1. Open a new window at https://stackexchange.com/oauth/dialog, with these query string parameters\n\n        - client_id\n\n        - scope (details)\n\n        - redirect_uri - must be under an apps registered domain\n\n        - state - optional\n\n        2. The user approves your app\n\n        3. The user is redirected to redirect_uri, with these parameters in the hash\n\n        - access_token\n\n        - expires - optional, only if scope doesn't contain no_expiry\n\n        The explicit flow should be used by server-side applications, with special care taken to never leak client_secret. Client side applications should use the implicit flow.\n\n\n        Once you have authenticated a user once, regardless of flow, subsequent re-authorizations will occur without requiring user action. Naturally, should a user revoke an applications permissions then further action will be required to re-authorize.\n\n\n        Applications using the implicit flow can make use of our provided minimalistic Javascript SDK.\n\n\n        #Scope\n\n\n        With an empty scope, authentication will only allow an application to identify a user via the /me method. In order to access other information, different scope values must be sent. Multiple values may be sent in scope by comma or space delimitting them.\n\n\n        - read_inbox - access a user's global inbox\n\n        - no_expiry - access_token's with this scope do not expire\n\n        - write_access - perform write operations as a user 2.1\n\n        - private_info - access full history of a user's private actions on the site 2.1\n\n\n        #Desktop Applications\n\n\n        Desktop applications cannot participate directly in OAuth 2.0 flows, however the embeddable browser controls available in most frameworks make it possible to work around this limitation.\n\n\n        Desktop applications should use the implicit client-side flow, hosting the process within a browser control. For redirect_uri, a value of https://stackexchange.com/oauth/login_success should be used. Upon a successful authentication, access_token will be placed in the url hash as with a standard implicit authentication.\n\n\n        #Usage\n\n\n        Access tokens can be passed (as access_token) to any method to grant applications an increased throttle quota. When passing an access token an app must pass its request key as well, if you don't have a request key you can obtain one by registering your application on Stack Apps (http://stackapps.com/users/login?returnurl=/apps/oauth/register).\n      type: oauth2\n      flows:\n        implicit:\n          authorizationUrl: https://stackexchange.com/oauth\n          scopes:
