Protobuf\n        library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form of utility\n        functions or additional generated methods of the Any type. Example 1: Pack\n        and unpack a message in C++. Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ...\n        if (any.UnpackTo(\u0026foo)) { ... } Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.\n        Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ... if (any.is(Foo.class)) { foo =\n        any.unpack(Foo.class); } Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python. foo\n        = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR): any.Unpack(foo)\n        ... Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go foo := \u0026pb.Foo{...} any, err\n        := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo) ... foo := \u0026pb.Foo{} if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any,\n        foo); err != nil { ... } The pack methods provided by protobuf library will\n        by default use ''type.googleapis.com/full.type.name'' as the type URL and\n        the unpack methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last ''/''\n        in the type URL, for example \"foo.bar.com/x/y.z\" will yield type name \"y.z\".\n        # JSON The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular representation\n        of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field `@type` which\n        contains the type URL. Example: package google.profile; message Person { string\n        first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; } { \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\",\n        \"firstName\": , \"lastName\": } If the embedded message type is well-known and\n        has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded adding\n        a field `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type` field.\n        Example (for message google.protobuf.Duration): { \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\",\n        \"value\": \"1.212s\" }'\n      properties:\n        typeUrl:\n          description: 'A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the\n            serialized protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least\n            one \"/\" character. The last segment of the URL''s path must represent\n            the fully qualified name of the type (as in `path/google.protobuf.Duration`).\n            The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading \".\" is not accepted).\n            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they\n            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the\n            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type\n            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows: * If no\n            scheme is provided, `https` is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must\n            yield a google.protobuf.Type value in binary format, or produce an error.\n            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or\n            have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore, binary\n            compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned\n            type names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality is not\n            currently available in the official protobuf release, and it is not used\n            for type URLs beginning with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than `http`,\n            `https` (or the empty scheme) might be used with implementation specific\n            semantics.'\n          type: string\n        value:\n          description: Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above specified\n            type.\n          format: byte\n          type: string\n      type: object\n    AppStartTime:\n      properties:\n        fullyDrawnTime:\n          $ref: '#/components/schemas/Duration'\n          description: Optional.
