Four design considerations were made to remain compatible with EPCIS 1.2:\n        - EPCIS 2.0 keeps event IDs optional. If event IDs are missing, the server should populate the event ID with a unique value.\n        Otherwise, it won't be possible to retrieve these events by eventID.\n        - By default, EPCIS events are only stored if the entire capture job was successful. This behaviour can be changed with the `GS1-Capture-Error-Behaviour` header.\n        - EPCIS master data can be captured in the header (`epcisHeader`) of an `EPCISDocument`.\n        - This endpoint should support both `EPCISDocument` and `EPCISQueryDocument` as input.\n        To prevent timeouts for large payloads, the client potentially may need to split the payload into several capture calls. To that end, the server can specify a capture\n        limit (number of EPCIS events) and file size limit (payload size).\n        A successful capturing of events does not guarantee that events will be stored. Instead, the server returns a\n        capture id, which the client can use to obtain information about the capture job.\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n                    oneOf:\n                      - $ref: 'https://gs1.github.io/EPCIS/REST%20Bindings/JSON-Schema-Stub.json#/definitions/epcisQueryDocument'\n                      - $ref: 'https://gs1.github.io/EPCIS/REST%20Bindings/JSON-Schema-Stub.json#/definitions/epcisDocument'\n            example:\n              $ref: 'https://gs1.github.io/EPCIS/JSON/Example_9.6.1-ObjectEvent.jsonld'\n      responses:\n        '202':\n          description: |\n            Successfully received one or more EPCIS events.

It returns\n        EPCIS events up to the amount defined in `perPage`. The server returns a `Link` header to point to the remaining\n        results.\n        Optionally, EPCIS events can be further filtered using the EPCIS Query Language as query string parameters.\n        Example:\n        ```\n        https://example.com/dispositions/in_progress?GE_eventTime=2015-03-15T00%3A00%3A00.000-04%3A00\n        ```\n        An EPCIS 2.0 query may also be expressed via the URI query string.  The query parameters with fixed fieldnames are included in this OpenAPI interface.  However, this list is not exhaustive and the EPCIS 2.0 standard defines additional query parameters with flexible names, depending on the specific value of `uom`, `type` or `fieldname` that appears within the name of the parameter.\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/200EPCISQueryDocument'\n        '400':\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/400QueryIssues'\n        '401':\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/401UnauthorizedRequest'\n        '403':\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/403ClientUnauthorized'\n        '404':\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/404ResourceNotFound'\n        '414':\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/414URLTooLong'\n        '406':\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/406NotAcceptable'\n        '500':\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/500ImplementationException'\n\n  /queries:\n    options:\n      tags:\n        - 'Discovery'\n      summary: Query the metadata of the EPCIS queries endpoint.\n      parameters:\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/GS1-Extensions'\n      description: |\n        EPCIS 2.0 supports a number of custom headers to describe custom vocabularies and support multiple versions\n        of EPCIS and CBV.

$ref: '#/components/parameters/GS1-CBV-XML-Format'\n      description: |\n        EPCIS 2.0 implementations must support Webhook subscriptions. \n        Creating a query subscription requires the client to provide a single endpoint to which the\n        server will send events (as `EPCISQueryDocument`) and an optional string `signatureToken`. \n        This `signatureToken` must be generated by the client and is used by the server to authenticate itself and sign messages when sending events. The signature must be contained on the `GS1-Signature` HTTP header of the server request. \n        \n        The choice of signature type is implementation specific but examples would be using HMAC with SHA-256 directly or a wrapper supporting various symmetric or asymetric \n        cryptographic algorithms such as Json Web Signature (JWS).\n        When the client subscribes to a query, it must either set `stream` to `true`, to be notified whenever a new EPCIS\n        event matches the query, or the client must define a query schedule. If these are missing the query subscription is invalid because the server won't\n        know when to notify a client.\n        ## Scheduled query: Receive query results at 1.05am\n        A scheduled query subscription is a time-based query execution. EPCIS 2.0 scheduled queries are scheduled\n        in the same manner as cron jobs.\n        For example, this query subscription is scheduled to trigger every morning at 1.05am. By setting\n        `reportIfEmpty` to `true`, the client's callback URL (`dest`) will be called even if there are no new events that match\n        the query.\n        ```\n        POST /queries/MyQuery/subscriptions\n        {\n          \"dest\": \"https://client.example.com/queryCallback\",\n          \"signatureToken\": \"13df38d8275b13f05704629e5f1cf3d45d6132d5\",\n          \"reportIfEmpty\": true,\n          \"schedule\": {\n            \"hour\":\"1\",\n            \"minute\": \"5\"\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n        ## Streaming query subscription: Whenever a captured EPCIS event matches the query criteria\n        If no query schedule is specified, the client must explicitly set `stream` to `true`. This restriction is to\n        prevent clients from accidentally subscribing to EPCIS event streams.\n        ```\n        POST /queries/MyQuery/subscriptions\n        {\n          \"dest\": \"https://client.example.com/queryCallback\",\n          \"signatureToken\": \"13df38d8275b13f05704629e5f1cf3d45d6132d5\",\n          \"stream\": true\n        }\n        ```\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            example: {\n              \"dest\": \"https://client.example.com/queryCallback\",\n              \"signatureToken\": \"13df38d8275b13f05704629e5f1cf3d45d6132d5\",\n              \"schedule\": { \"hour\": \"1\", \"minute\": \"5\" }\n            }\n            schema:\n              allOf:\n                - $ref: '#/components/schemas/AbstractQuerySubscription'\n                - oneOf:\n                    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/QueryScheduleSubscription'\n                    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/QueryStreamSubscription'\n      responses:\n        '201':\n          headers:\n            Location:\n              description: |\n                The server creates a new subscription for each client and query subscription.
