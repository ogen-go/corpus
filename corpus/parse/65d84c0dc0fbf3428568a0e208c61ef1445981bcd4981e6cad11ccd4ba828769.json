(even though the paths are defined in random order in the spec but they are shown in the order as they are defined under `tags` section)\n\n      - If there are multiple paths inside a tag, they can be further sorted. Use `sort-endpoints-by` property which can accept `path`, `method`, `summary` or `none`\n      - If you do not want to specify tag order, but follow certain naming conventions for tags in the spec you may use `sort-tags` property in RapiDoc element to sort tags alphabetically\n\n    ```yaml\n      openapi: 3.0.0\n      info:\n        title: Arranging by Tags\n        version: 1.0.0\n\n      tags:  # \u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c Define the order of the Tags using tags object at root level\n        - name: The First Tag\n        - name: And Second Tag\n        - name: 3rd Tag\n\n      paths:\n        /path-3.1:\n          get:\n            summary: This path belongs to third tag\n            tags:\n              - 3rd Tag\n        /path-1.1:\n          get:\n            summary: This path belongs to first tag\n            tags:\n              - The First Tag\n        /path-2.1:\n          get:\n            summary: First path of 2nd Tag\n            tags:\n              - And Second Tag\n        /path-2.2:\n          get:\n            summary: Second path of 2nd Tag\n            tags:\n              - And Second Tag\n        /common-path-in-first-and-3rd-tag:\n          get:\n            summary: Path belongs to First and 3rd Tag\n            tags:    # \u003c\u003c\u003c Paths can belong to multiple Tags\n              - The First Tag\n              - 3rd Tag\n        /no-tag/path:\n          get:\n            summary: This path do not have any tag\n\n    ```\npaths:\n  /path-3.1:\n    get:\n      summary: This path belongs to third tag\n      tags:\n        - 3rd Tag\n\n  /path-1.1:\n    get:\n      summary: This path belongs to first tag\n      tags:\n        - The First Tag\n\n  /path-2.1:\n    get:\n      summary: First path of 2nd Tag\n      tags:\n        - And Second Tag\n  /path-2.2:\n    get:\n      summary: Second path of 2nd Tag\n      tags:\n        - And Second Tag\n\n  /common-path-in-first-and-3rd-tag:\n    get:\n      summary: Path belongs to First and 3rd Tag\n      tags:\n        - The First Tag\n        - 3rd Tag\n  /no-tag/path:\n    get:\n      summary: This path do not have any tag\n\ntags:\n  - name: The First Tag\n  - name: And Second Tag\n  - name: 3rd Tag\n"
