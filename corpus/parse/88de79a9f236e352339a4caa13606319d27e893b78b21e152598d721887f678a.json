The <b> items</b> container has an array of  containers with the details of each item in the group. The <b> commonDescriptions</b> container has an array of containers for a description and the item ids of all the items that have this exact description.

Because a cart never expires, any item added to the cart will remain in the cart until it is removed.  <br /><br />To use this method, you must submit a RESTful item ID and the quantity of the item. If the <b> quantity</b> value is greater than the number of available, the <b> quantity</b> value is changed to the number available and a warning is returned. For example, if there are 15 baseballs available and you set the <b> quantity</b> value to 50, the service automatically changes the value of <b>quantity</b> to 15.    <br /><br />The response returns all the items in the eBay member's cart; items added to the cart while on ebay.com as well as items added to the cart using the Browse API.   The quantity and state of an item changes often. If the item becomes \\\"unavailable\\\" such as, when the listing has ended or the item is out of stock, whether it has just been added to the cart or has been in the cart for some time, the item will be returned in the <b> unavailableCartItems</b> container.</p>       <p span class=\\\"tablenote\\\"><b>Note: </b>There are differences between how legacy APIs, such as Finding, and RESTful APIs, such as Browse, return the identifier of an \\\"item\\\" and what the item ID represents.
