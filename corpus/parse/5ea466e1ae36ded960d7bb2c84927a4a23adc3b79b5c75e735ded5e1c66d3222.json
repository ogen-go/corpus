It powers tools that bring security into the\\nsmart contract SDLC.\\n\\nJoin the MythX community at [MythX\\nDiscord](https://discord.gg/kktn8Wt) for more information.\\n\\nThis document describes the API interface to MythX. It is entended\\nfor Dapp developers who wish to bring the power MythX to their\\nDapps.\\n\\n# API Authentication Methods\\n\\nMythX API implements [JWT](#section/API-Authentication-Methods/JWT) and\\n[MetaMask](#section/API-Authentication-Methods/MetaMask) authentication schemes.\\nFor better security user credentials (User ID / Ethereum address / email +\\npassword) are only used to start JWT sessions\\n\\n\u003c!-- ReDoc-Inject: \u003csecurity-definitions\u003e --\u003e\\n\\n# User Roles and Permissions\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nMythX user roles and permissions are string tokens recognized by API server,\\nand utilized to control user access to different API functionalities, as well\\nas to alter API behavior for user with different rights.\\n\\nUser roles assigned to each user can be found inside the `roles` array of user\\nobject (see [GET /users/{id}](#operation/getUserById)). Each role represents a\\nset of user permissions. The exact mapping between roles and permissions is\\nstored server-side and may be changed as needed, thus allowing to tune API\\nbehavior for users with certain roles without chaning user roles.\\n\\nWhen a user hits API, his roles are mapped into sets of permissions that\\ncorrespond to these roles currently, and all these permissions are merged\\ninto a single permissions set. Endpoint controllers then check as necessary\\nfor the presence of required permissions in that set, to decide how different\\nfeatures should work for the user, or whether corresponding functionality\\nshould work for the user at all. To check permissions currently granted to\\nthe user by his roles use\\n[GET /users/{id}/permissions](#operation/getUserPermissions).\\n\\nWhen a new [JWT session](#section/API-Authentication-Methods/JWT) is opened\\nby [POST /auth/login](#operation/login), it is possible to narrow down user\\npermissions allowed for that session. For example, it allows to use JWT tokens\\nas API keys for tools, that only allow to run analyses, and retrieve their\\nresults, but do not allow to modify user details, etc. To check user\\npermissions requested, and granted in the current JWT session see\\n[GET /auth/session/permissions](#operation/getSessionPermissions).\\n\\nFor convenience, [GET /auth/login](#operation/login) and\\n[GET /auth/refresh](#operation/loginRefresh) endpoints also return\\ninformation on the permissions.\\n\\n## Valid User Permissions\\n\\n**MythX Usage Allowances**\\n- `ALL_SWC_LOOKUP` - Allows to see issues with all SWCs. Without this\\n  permission only issues from a limited subset of SWC will be returned\\n  to the user, along with a warning issue.\\n- `ANALYSIS_ALLOWANCE_MINIMAL` - Up to 1k analyses any 24h period.\\n- `ANALYSIS_ALLOWANCE_PREMIUM` - Up to 10k analyses any 24 period.\\n- `FULL_ANALYSIS` - Allows to run analyses in the `full` mode.\\n- `NO_CACHE_LOOKUP` - Allows to use `noCacheLookup` option in analysis\\n  requests.\\n- `PARALLEL_ANALYSIS_REQUESTS_UNLIMITED` - Allows to queue unlimited number\\n  of unfinished analyses.\\n- `ANALYSES_LOOKUP_OWN` - Permits to look up your own past analyses, using\\n  [GET /v1/analyses](#operation/listAnalyses).\\n- `REQUEST_RATE_PER_IP` - Allows multiple users relying on the same MythX\\n  account to have their usage limits to be applied on per-IP basis.\\n- ~`ANALYSIS_ALLOWANCE_UNLIMITED`~ - Has no effect currently, and falls back\\n  to up to 1k analyses any 24h period.\\n- ~`SHARED_USER_REQUEST_RATE`~ - Replaced by `ANALYSIS_ALLOWANCE_*`\\n  permissions.\\n- ~`UNLIMITED_REQUEST_RATE`~ - Replaced by `ANALYSIS_ALLOWANCE_*`\\n  permissions.\\n\\n**Account Management Permissions**\\n- `CREATE_USERS_ADMIN` - Allows to create new users with `admin` role,\\n  as well as grant / take this role for created accounts.\\n- `CREATE_USERS_FREE` - Allows to create new users with the `Free` role,\\n  as well as grant / take this role for created accounts.\\n- `CREATE_USERS_PARTNER` - Allows to create new users with `parnter` role,\\n  as well as grant / take this role for created accounts.\\n- `CREATE_USERS_PREMIUM` - Allows to create new users with\\n  the `Premium` role, as well as grant / take this role for created\\n  accounts.\\n- `CREATE_USERS_PROFESSIONAL` - Allows to create new users with\\n  the `Professional` role, as well as grant / take this role for created\\n  accounts.\\n- `CREATE_USERS_TRUSTED` - Allows to create new users with\\n  the `trusted_user` role, as well as grant / take this role for created\\n  accounts.\\n- `CREATE_USERS_WITHOUT_ROLES` - Allows to create new user accounts.\\n- `CHANGE_PASSWORD_OWN` - Permits to change your own user password.\\n- `USER_LOOKUP` - Allows to lookup accounts of other users.\\n\\n**Misc Permissions**\\n- `USERS_ANALYSES_STATS_LOOKUP` - Allows to fetch internal stats on MythX\\n  usage and performance.\\n\"\n  },\n  \"paths\": {\n    \"/auth/challenge\": {\n      \"get\": {\n        \"operationId\": \"getAuthChallenge\",\n        \"summary\": \"Auth challenge\",\n        \"tags\": [\n          \"Authentication Calls\"\n        ],\n        \"description\": \"Generates authentication challenge.\\n\\nAt least one of query parameters must be provided, and it will determine\\nthe type of challenge to generate.
