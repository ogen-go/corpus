A single `Action` represents a repeatable action that can be performed by the execution service. `Action`s can be succinctly identified by the digest of their wire format encoding and, once an `Action` has been executed, will be cached in the action cache. Future requests can then use the cached result rather than needing to run afresh. When a server completes execution of an Action, it MAY choose to cache the result in the ActionCache unless `do_not_cache` is `true`. Clients SHOULD expect the server to do so. By default, future calls to Execute the same `Action` will also serve their results from the cache. Clients must take care to understand the caching behaviour. Ideally, all `Action`s will be reproducible so that serving a result from cache is always desirable and correct.\n      properties:\n        commandDigest:\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Digest\"\n          description: The digest of the Command to run, which MUST be present in the ContentAddressableStorage.\n        doNotCache:\n          description: If true, then the `Action`'s result cannot be cached, and in-flight requests for the same `Action` may not be merged.\n          type: boolean\n        inputRootDigest:\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Digest\"\n          description: The digest of the root Directory for the input files.

The server SHOULD impose a timeout if the client does not specify one, however, if the client does specify a timeout that is longer than the server's maximum timeout, the server MUST reject the request. The timeout is a part of the Action message, and therefore two `Actions` with different timeouts are different, even if they are otherwise identical. This is because, if they were not, running an `Action` with a lower timeout than is required might result in a cache hit from an execution run with a longer timeout, hiding the fact that the timeout is too short. By encoding it directly in the `Action`, a lower timeout will result in a cache miss and the execution timeout will fail immediately, rather than whenever the cache entry gets evicted.\n          format: google-duration\n          type: string\n      type: object\n    BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2ActionResult:\n      description: An ActionResult represents the result of an Action being run.

A digest for a given blob consists of the size of the blob and its hash. The hash algorithm to use is defined by the server. The size is considered to be an integral part of the digest and cannot be separated. That is, even if the `hash` field is correctly specified but `size_bytes` is not, the server MUST reject the request. The reason for including the size in the digest is as follows: in a great many cases, the server needs to know the size of the blob it is about to work with prior to starting an operation with it, such as flattening Merkle tree structures or streaming it to a worker. Technically, the server could implement a separate metadata store, but this results in a significantly more complicated implementation as opposed to having the client specify the size up-front (or storing the size along with the digest in every message where digests are embedded). This does mean that the API leaks some implementation details of (what we consider to be) a reasonable server implementation, but we consider this to be a worthwhile tradeoff. When a `Digest` is used to refer to a proto message, it always refers to the message in binary encoded form. To ensure consistent hashing, clients and servers MUST ensure that they serialize messages according to the following rules, even if there are alternate valid encodings for the same message: * Fields are serialized in tag order. * There are no unknown fields. * There are no duplicate fields. * Fields are serialized according to the default semantics for their type. Most protocol buffer implementations will always follow these rules when serializing, but care should be taken to avoid shortcuts. For instance, concatenating two messages to merge them may produce duplicate fields.\"\n      properties:\n        hash:\n          description: The hash.

Each `Node` contains its name in the directory, either the digest of its content (either a file blob or a `Directory` proto) or a symlink target, as well as possibly some metadata about the file or directory. In order to ensure that two equivalent directory trees hash to the same value, the following restrictions MUST be obeyed when constructing a a `Directory`: * Every child in the directory must have a path of exactly one segment. Multiple levels of directory hierarchy may not be collapsed. * Each child in the directory must have a unique path segment (file name). Note that while the API itself is case-sensitive, the environment where the Action is executed may or may not be case-sensitive. That is, it is legal to call the API with a Directory that has both \"Foo\" and \"foo\" as children, but the Action may be rejected by the remote system upon execution. * The files, directories and symlinks in the directory must each be sorted in lexicographical order by path. The path strings must be sorted by code point, equivalently, by UTF-8 bytes. * The NodeProperties of files, directories, and symlinks must be sorted in lexicographical order by property name.

The server MAY use the `value` of one or more properties to determine how it sets up the execution environment, such as by making specific system files available to the worker. Both names and values are typically case-sensitive.
