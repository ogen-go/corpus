This API should be used to request whether the patient's coverage is in force, whether it is valid at this or specified date, and/or for requesting the benefits \u0026 plan details associated with the coverage. \n         \n         Providers should send the following details in the request body while making a call for coverage eligibility check:\n         1. A set of header attributes that provide transport, security, message integrity and summary information about the message being exchanged. This information is used by the HCX gateway for routing the request and auditing purposes.\n         2. Domain payload containing the CoverageEligibilityRequest domain entity (eObject) as prescribed for the use case by the [domain specifications](https://docs.hcxprotocol.io/hcx-domain-specifications/domain-data-models#coverage-eligibility-request). This needs to be encrypted so that HCX cannot read this and can be decrypted \u0026 processed only by the intended recipient.\n        \n        \n        Overall, the request body (header attributes and the FHIR document) should be sent in the form of a JWE token ([RFC-7516](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516)) using the steps defined in [HCX specs](https://docs.hcxprotocol.io/hcx-technical-specifications/open-protocol/data-security-and-privacy/message-security-and-integrity#message-encryption).\n        \n        \n        The response to this API could be one of the following:\n          1. A successful accepted response from the HCX gateway if the strucuture of the request is valid and the validation of open attributes (protocol headers) is successful. Upon successful validation, HCX gateway forwards the same request to the intended recipient asynchronously.\n          2. An error response if any of the validations fail.\n          \n        If the request is successfully accepted by the HCX gateway and forwarded to the recipient (i.e. the payor), the provider (who made the Coverage Eligibility Request API call) should expect the response via a call back to Coverage Eligibility Response API asynchronously. The response API payload may either contain the requested coverage details or error details in case of any errors during  processing.\n        \n        \n        An alternate scenario is when the Payor might respond with a redirect instruction asking the Provider to submit the same request to another Payor.\n        \n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/JWEPayload'\n      responses:\n        '202':\n          description: Accepted\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/SuccessResponse'\n        '400':\n          description: Request Validation failed\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse'\n        '404':\n          description: Requested resource was not found\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse'\n        '500':\n          description: Downstream systems down/unhandled exceptions.\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse'\n      security:\n      - bearer_auth: []\n  /coverageeligibility/on_check:\n    post:\n      tags:\n        - Coverage Eligibility APIs\n      externalDocs:\n        description: Coverage Eligibility Response domain object\n        url: https://docs.hcxprotocol.io/hcx-domain-specifications/domain-data-models#coverage-eligibility-response\n      description: \u003e-\n        This is a callback API is for payors/proessors to send the response for a coverage eligibility request from the providers/originator.

Authentication tag (**authentication_tag**) - Digital signature on the protected header and the payload of the message to ensure its integrity.\n            \n            \n            The final payload should be serialzed using JWE compact serialization as defined in the RFC-7516 - \n            \n            \n            **protected || '.' || encrypted_key || '.' || iv || '.' || ciphertext || '.' || authentication_tag**\n            \n            \n            Detailed steps on how to construct the JWE token are provided in this [section](https://docs.hcxprotocol.io/hcx-technical-specifications/open-protocol/data-security-and-privacy/message-security-and-integrity#message-encryption) of the HCX specifications.\n          example: \"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.6KB707dM9YTIgHtLvtgWQ8mKwboJW3of9locizkDTHzBC2IlrT1oOQ.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.KDlTtXchhZTGufMYmOYGS4HffxPSUrfmqCHXaI9wOGY.Mz-VPPyU4RlcuYv1IwIvzw\"\n          properties:\n            protected:\n              type: object\n              format: string\n              description: Protected headers contain information that helps HCX gateway to identify senders, receivers of the message, perform integrity checks, audits and routing functionality. Header values are posted in clear and must never contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) about the patient or any person. HCX protocol uses JWE protected headers for such information to ensure these are not tampered with by the intermediate gateways. Protected Headers for HCX will be the union of the following three header categories.\n          \n                1. JOSE Headers - JSON Web encryption header as per [RFC7516](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516#section-4). For HCX V1, this is proposed to be fixed to {\"alg\":\"RSA-OAEP\",\"enc\":\"A256GCM\"}.\n            \n                2. HCX Protocol Headers - Private headers as per [RFC7516 section 4.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516#section-4.3). List of header values that are allowed in HCX APIs and their details are defined in this [section](https://docs.hcxprotocol.io/hcx-technical-specifications/open-protocol/key-components-building-blocks/message-structure#hcx-protocol-headers) of HCX Specifications.\n            \n                3. HCX Domain Headers - JSON object containing a map of domain-specific header values as proposed in domain data specifications for each entity. E.g. For claims use cases, domain specs may decide to populate the total claimed amount, list of diagnostics/procedures. Please note that all such parameter names must follow the naming convention _x-hcx-\u003cuse_case_name\u003e-\u003cparameter_name\u003e_.\n            \n            \n                  Overall, the protected headers should be created as - \n                  \n                  \n                  JWE Protected Header = BASE64URL(UTF8( (JOSE headers) + (HCX Protocol Headers) + (HCX Domain Headers) ))\n              allOf:\n                - $ref: '#/components/schemas/JOSEHeader'\n                - $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProtocolHeader'\n                - $ref: '#/components/schemas/DomainHeaders'\n              example: \"eyJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0\"\n              \n            encrypted_key:\n              type: string\n              description: The JWE encrypted key should be generated using the following process\n            \n                1. A random content encryption key (CEK) has to be generated by the sender. \n            \n                2. Encrypt the CEK with the recipient's public key using the RSAES-OAEP algorithm to produce the JWE Encrypted Key.\n            \n                3. Base64url-encode the JWE Encrypted Key.\n          \n            \n                The encrypted \u0026 base64 encoded key should be set as the encrypted_key in the JWE token and also used for encrypting the domain payload (i.e. the FHIR resource) to be sent in the request. The recipient shall decrypt the content encryption key using their private key (corresponding to the public key used by the sender) and use the decrypted CEK for decrypting the domain payload. \n              \n              example: \"6KB707dM9YTIgHtLvtgWQ8mKwboJW3of9locizkDTHzBC2IlrT1oOQ\"\n            \n            iv:\n              type: string\n              description: Initialization vector (_iv_) is needed in the encryption process of the payload and for the recipient (along with the encrypted_key and aad) to subsequently decrypt the payload. The \"iv\" should be created by generating a random JWE initialization vector and Base64url-encoding the JWE initialization vector. \n              example: \"AxY8DCtDaGlsbGljb3RoZQ\"\n              \n            ciphertext:\n              type: string\n              description: _ciphertext_ contains the domain payload (that has to  be sent to the recipient) in encrypted form. Usecase specific   JSON payload defined in the [eObjects](https://docs.hcxprotocol.io/hcx-domain-specifications/domain-data-models#eobjects) section of the HCX specifications (i.e. the FHIR resource defined for the use case, e.g. CoverageEligibilityRequest document for coverage eligibility request API) should be encrypted as per JWE specification and sent as the _ciphertext_ in the request.\n          \n          \n                Steps to create the ciphertext element - \n            \n                1. Create the JSON payload for the API request as per the [eObjects specification](https://docs.hcxprotocol.io/hcx-domain-specifications/domain-data-models#eobjects).\n            \n                2. Perform authenticated encryption on the JSON payload with the AES GCM algorithm using the CEK as the encryption key (_encrypted_key_), the JWE Initialization Vector (_iv_)), and the Additional Authenticated Data value (_aad_), requesting a 128-bit Authentication Tag output. This step outputs a ciphertext and an authentication tag (_tag_).\n            \n                3. Base64url-encode the ciphertext output from the previous step and set it as the _ciphertext_ element in the request body.\n              example: \"KDlTtXchhZTGufMYmOYGS4HffxPSUrfmqCHXaI9wOGY\"\n              \n            authentication_tag:\n              type: string\n              description: The authentication tag generated as an output of the payload encryption algorithm (used for creating the _ciphertext_) should be sent as the _tag_ element in the request body.

The recipient must set the same correlation id in the response API call and in other API calls related to the original request (e.g. communication request, forward/redirect requests). And the same correlation id must be sent in all subsequent API calls (related to the same cycle).\n            \n            \n            In case of status API call, this header should have the correlation id of the request for which the status is being requested for.\n          format: uuid\n        x-hcx-workflow_id:\n          type: string\n          description: Unique id for one complete workflow that spans over a series of cycles and message exchanges within the context of an admission/case.\n            \n            \n            This is an optional header that can be set by providers to the same value for all requests (coverage eligibility check, preauth, claim, etc) related to a single admission/case. And when the workflow_id is sent by the originating provider, all other participant systems (payors) must set the same workflow id in all API calls (responses, forwards/redirects, payment notices, etc) related to the workflow.\n          format: uuid\n        x-hcx-timestamp:\n          type: string\n          description: Unix timestamp when the request is sent.\n          example: \"1629057611000\"\n        x-hcx-debug_flag:\n          type: string\n          description: Request to the server to include debug information.
