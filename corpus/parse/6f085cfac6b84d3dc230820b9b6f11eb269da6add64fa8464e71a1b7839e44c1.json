A resync operation will cause all documents in the database to be reprocessed through the database sync function. \n\n        Generally, a resync operation might be wanted when the sync function has been modified in such a way that the channel or access mappings for any existing documents would change as a result.\n\n        A resync operation cannot be run if the database is online. The database can be taken offline by calling the `POST /{db}/_offline` endpoint.\n\n        In a multi-node cluster, the resync operation *must* be run on only a single node. Therefore, users should bring other nodes offline before initiating this action.

The operation removes *all* revisions (active and tombstones) for the specified document(s). A common usage of this endpoint is to remove tombstone documents that are no longer needed, thus recovering storage space and reducing data replicated to clients. Other clients are not notified when a revision has been purged; so in order to purge a revision from the system it must be done from all databases (on Couchbase Lite and Sync Gateway).\n\n        When `enable_shared_bucket_access` is enabled, this endpoint removes the document and its associated extended attributes.\n      requestBody:\n        description: Purge request body\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n              properties:\n                doc_id:\n                  description: |-\n                    The document ID to purge.

The 2 options will:\n        * `tombstone` - purge the JSON bodies of non-leaf revisions. This is known as database compaction. Database compaction is done periodically automatically by the system. JSON bodies of leaf nodes (conflicting branches) are not removed therefore it is important to resolve conflicts in order to re-claim disk space.\n        * `attachment` - purge all unlinked/unused legacy (pre 3.0) attachments. If the previous attachment compact operation failed, this will attempt to restart the `compact_id` at the appropriate phase (if possible).\n\n        Both types can each have a maximum of 1 compact operation running at any one point. This means that an attachment compaction can be running at the same time as a tombstone compaction but not 2 tombstone compactions.\n      parameters:\n        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/compact-type'\n        - name: action\n          in: query\n          description: Defines whether the a compact operation is being started or stopped.\n          schema:\n            type: string\n            default: start\n            enum:\n              - start\n              - stop\n        - name: reset\n          in: query\n          description: '**Attachment compaction only**: This forces a fresh compact start instead of trying to resume the previous failed compact operation.'\n          schema:\n            type: boolean\n        - name: dry_run\n          in: query\n          description: '**Attachment compaction only**: This will run through all 3 stages of attachment compact but will not purge any attachments.

Couchbase Server expiries are specified as Unix time, and if the desired TTL is below 30 days then it can also represent an interval in seconds from the current time (for example, a value of 5 will remove the document 5 seconds after it is written to Couchbase Server). The document expiration time is returned in the response of `GET /{db}/{doc} ` when `show_exp=true` is included in the query.\n\n            As with the existing explicit purge mechanism, this applies only to the local database; it has nothing to do with replication.
