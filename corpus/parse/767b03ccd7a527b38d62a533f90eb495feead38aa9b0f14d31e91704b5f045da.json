As an\n                    example, if your website is `RunClub` and the item you're charging\n                    for is a race ticket, you may want to specify a `statement_descriptor`\n                    of `RunClub 5K race ticket`. The statement description must contain\n                    at least one letter, may not include `\u003c\u003e\"'` characters, and will\n                    appear on your customer's statement in capital letters. Non-ASCII\n                    characters are automatically stripped. Updating this value will\n                    overwrite the previous statement descriptor of this charge. While\n                    most banks display this information consistently, some may display\n                    it incorrectly or not at all.\n                  maxLength: 22\n                  type: string\n              type: object\n        required: false\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/charge\"\n          description: Successful response.\n        default:\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/error\"\n          description: Error response.\n  \"/v1/charges/{charge}/dispute\":\n    get:\n      description: ''\n      operationId: RetrieveChargeDispute\n      parameters:\n      - in: path\n        name: charge\n        required: true\n        schema:\n          maxLength: 5000\n          type: string\n        style: simple\n      - description: Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.\n        explode: true\n        in: query\n        name: expand\n        required: false\n        schema:\n          items:\n            maxLength: 5000\n            type: string\n          type: array\n        style: deepObject\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/dispute\"\n          description: Successful response.\n        default:\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/error\"\n          description: Error response.\n    post:\n      description: ''\n      operationId: UpdateChargeDispute\n      parameters:\n      - in: path\n        name: charge\n        required: true\n        schema:\n          maxLength: 5000\n          type: string\n        style: simple\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/x-www-form-urlencoded:\n            encoding:\n              evidence:\n                explode: true\n                style: deepObject\n              expand:\n                explode: true\n                style: deepObject\n              metadata:\n                explode: true\n                style: deepObject\n            schema:\n              additionalProperties: false\n              properties:\n                evidence:\n                  description: Evidence to upload, to respond to a dispute.
