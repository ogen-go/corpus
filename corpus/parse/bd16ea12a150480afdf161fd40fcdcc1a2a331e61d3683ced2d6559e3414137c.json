The invitation sends users to begin the OAuth flow for the current application (based on the settings specified in the application's profile), and therefore they will be redirected to the application upon signing up / logging in. Upon doing so, if they aren't already, they will automatically be connected with you as well. If your current access token does not escape the bubble, the invitation will specify you wish to connect within the application's name. If your current access token escapes the bubble, the invitation will specify you wish to connect within Dazah. Submit either a list of emails, or a LinkedIn or Outlook CSV file. You can retrieve your LinkedIn CSV file by exporting your LinkedIn Connections at https://www.linkedin.com/people/export-settings. You can retrieve your Outlook CSV file by using the Outlook Import and Export Wizard. This endpoint buckets the invitations into four categories: Existing invites are existing users who are already connected with you within the current bubble, and are therefore not emailed; Discovered invites are existing Dazah users who are available to be connected with within the current bubble, and are therefore not emailed. Now that they have been discovered, the users/{:ID}/meet API endpoint may be used to connect with them; Invalid invites are existing Dazah users who are unavailable to be connected with, because they have deactivated accounts, are muting you, etc., and are therefore not emailed; Emailed invites are queued to receive an invitation within approximately 1 hour. Note that if you are attempting to invite an existing Dazah user who does not currently exist within your current access token's bubble, they will fall within the Discovered bucket if your current access token escapes the bubble, but will be emailed an invitation to join the application if your current access token does not escape the bubble.\"\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          multipart/form-data:\n            schema:\n              properties:\n                csv:\n                  format: binary\n                  type: string\n                \"emails[]\":\n                  items:\n                    type: string\n                  type: array\n              type: object\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Endpoint-post-users-invites\"\n          description: Valid Response\n      security:\n        - explicit_flow:\n            - profile_read\n            - conversations_write\n        - implicit_flow:\n            - profile_read\n            - conversations_write\n      tags:\n        - users\n  /users/metadata/filters:\n    post:\n      description: Paginated listing of users filtered by arbitrary metadata criteria.

By default, results are filtered such that all words in the string must exist, unless you seprate the words with OR. To perform a weighted search (as opposed to filtering), specify the weight (from 0-100) the search algorithm should assign to the field. You can optionally exclude users who you are already in or not in conversations with, exclude users who you previously skipped, or exclude users who you are muting. By doing so, you can effectively customize your own matching algorithm. You can specify geo coordinates to only find users a certain distance away from a specific location, or only find users within a certain distance from the OAuth'ed end-user's last known location. If your app utilizes multiple audience segments, you can specify which audiences you would like to search. You can also limit users to just those who have been recently active. You can also choose to only receive users originating from the current access token's bubble. Only users existing within the current access token's bubble will be matched, and you can only search within a group created by a bubbled user.\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          multipart/form-data:\n            schema:\n              properties:\n                active_within_x_days:\n                  format: int32\n                  type: integer\n                \"audience_ids[]\":\n                  items:\n                    format: int32\n                    type: integer\n                  type: array\n                bubbled:\n                  default: false\n                  type: boolean\n                exclude_connections:\n                  default: false\n                  type: boolean\n                exclude_matches:\n                  default: false\n                  type: boolean\n                exclude_muted:\n                  default: false\n                  type: boolean\n                exclude_skipped:\n                  default: false\n                  type: boolean\n                geo_latitude:\n                  format: float\n                  type: number\n                geo_longitude:\n                  format: float\n                  type: number\n                geo_miles_away:\n                  format: float\n                  type: number\n                group_id:\n                  format: int32\n                  type: integer\n                limit:\n                  default: 50\n                  format: int32\n                  type: integer\n                location_city_query:\n                  type: string\n                location_city_weight:\n                  format: int32\n                  type: integer\n                location_country_query:\n                  type: string\n                location_country_weight:\n                  format: int32\n                  type: integer\n                location_region_query:\n                  type: string\n                location_region_weight:\n                  format: int32\n                  type: integer\n                metadata_0_key:\n                  type: string\n                metadata_0_query:\n                  type: string\n                metadata_0_weight:\n                  format: int32\n                  type: integer\n                metadata_1_key:\n                  type: string\n                metadata_1_query:\n                  type: string\n                metadata_1_weight:\n                  format: int32\n                  type: integer\n                metadata_2_key:\n                  type: string\n                metadata_2_query:\n                  type: string\n                metadata_2_weight:\n                  format: int32\n                  type: integer\n                offset:\n                  default: 0\n                  format: int32\n                  type: integer\n                position_organization_query:\n                  type: string\n                position_organization_weight:\n                  format: int32\n                  type: integer\n                position_role_query:\n                  type: string\n                position_role_weight:\n                  format: int32\n                  type: integer\n                position_summary_query:\n                  type: string\n                position_summary_weight:\n                  format: int32\n                  type: integer\n                profile_first_name_query:\n                  type: string\n                profile_first_name_weight:\n                  format: int32\n                  type: integer\n                profile_goals_query:\n                  type: string\n                profile_goals_weight:\n                  type: string\n                profile_headline_query:\n                  type: string\n                profile_headline_weight:\n                  format: int32\n                  type: integer\n                profile_industry_query:\n                  type: string\n                profile_industry_weight:\n                  format: int32\n                  type: integer\n                profile_last_name_query:\n                  type: string\n                profile_last_name_weight:\n                  format: int32\n                  type: integer\n                profile_pitch_query:\n                  type: string\n                profile_pitch_weight:\n                  format: int32\n                  type: integer\n              type: object\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Endpoint-post-users-searches\"\n          description: Valid Response\n      security:\n        - explicit_flow:\n            - basic\n        - implicit_flow:\n            - basic\n      tags:\n        - users\n  \"/users/{ID}\":\n    get:\n      description: Fetch an array of users.

You can only record CV data to your own account. However, any app that you have OAuth'ed against can do so. By default, you will receive CV data that all apps have recorded for the user.

The PayPal API can be leveraged to send payments programatically, provided the parameters passed in remain the same to ensure that the payment is correctly recorded. Once the payment has been recorded via PayPal IPN, the price to meet the user changes to $0.

Specify an object_id to only be notified on an event related to that specific Conversation ID, Group ID, or User ID. Your access token must have access to the user being tracked, user you are in the conversation with, or user who created the group. You must be connected with a user in order to keep track of their online status. Alternatively, do not specify an object_id to be notified on all events that are related to conversations you're in, groups you're a member of, or users you are in conversations with. You may only have one webhook for each object_id/event. The webhook URI must reside on your own server. Webhooks do not expire when the access token used to create them expires. However, they will temporarily cease to function if the user who created them deauthorizes access to the application (effectively no longer existing within the bubble), unless/until the user reauthorizes the application using OAuth.\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          multipart/form-data:\n            schema:\n              properties:\n                bubbled:\n
