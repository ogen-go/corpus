This facilitates automation of processes like reconciliation of payment into the account with external systems.\n\n    An outgoing payment is an instruction to make a payment out of the account.\n\n    A quote is a commitment from the account provider to deliver a particular amount to a receiver when sending a particular amount from the account. It is only valid for a limited time.\n\n    For privacy reasons a connection resource is not a sub-resource of an account.\n\n    All resource and collection resource representations use JSON and the media-type `application/json`.  \n\n    The `account` resource has three collections of sub-resources and a single **account holder** sub-resource:   \n    1. `/incoming-payments` contains the **incoming payment** sub-resources  \n    2. `/outgoing-payments` contains the **outgoing payment** sub-resources  \n    3. `/quotes` contains the **quote** sub-resources\n\n    There is no normative path for **connection** resources. In this documentation we use the path `/connections` but implementations may use any arbitrary path.\n\n    Access to resources and permission to execute the methods exposed by the API is determined by the grants given to the client represented by an access token used in API requests.\n  summary: An API for open access to financial accounts to send and receive payments.\n  contact:\n    email: tech@interledger.org\nservers:\n  - url: 'https://openpayments.guide'\ntags:\n  - name: account\n    description: account operations\n  - name: incoming-payment\n    description: incoming payment operations\n  - name: outgoing-payment\n    description: outgoing payment operations\n  - name: quote\n    description: quote operations\n  - name: stream-connection\n    description: interledger STREAM connections\npaths:\n  '/{accountId}':\n    get:\n      summary: Get a Payment Pointer\n      tags:\n        - account\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Account Found\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/account'\n              examples:\n                Get account for $openpayments.guide/alice:\n                  value:\n                    id: 'https://openpayments.guide/alice'\n                    publicName: Alice\n                    assetCode: USD\n                    assetScale: 2\n                    authServer: 'https://openpayments.guide/auth'\n        '404':\n          description: Account Not Found\n      operationId: get-public-account\n      description: |-\n        Retrieve the public information of the account represented by the Payment Pointer.\n\n        This end-point should be open to anonymous requests as it allows clients to verify a Payment Pointer URL and get the basic information required to construct new transactions and discover the grant request URL.\n\n        The content should be slow changing and cacheable for long periods.
