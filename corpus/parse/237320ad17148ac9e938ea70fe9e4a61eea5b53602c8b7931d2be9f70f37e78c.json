You can use the API to accept card payments\n    (including One-Click and 3D Secure), bank transfers, ewallets, and many other\n    payment methods.\n\n\n    To learn more about the API, visit [Classic integration](https://docs.adyen.com/classic-integration).\n\n\n    ## Authentication\n\n    To connect to the Payments API, you must use your basic authentication credentials.\n    For this, create your web service user, as described in [How to get the WS user\n    password](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials). Then\n    use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:\n\n\n    ```\n\n    curl\n\n    -U \"ws@Company.YourCompany\":\"YourWsPassword\" \\\n\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n\n    ...\n\n    ```\n\n    Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials\n    to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n\n    ## Versioning\n\n    Payments API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning)\n    using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format:\n    \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\n\n    For example:\n\n    ```\n\n    https://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Payment/v67/authorise\n\n    ```'\n  termsOfService: https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions\n  contact:\n    name: Adyen Developer Experience team\n    url: https://www.adyen.help/hc/en-us/community/topics\n    email: developer-experience@adyen.com\nx-groups:\n- General\n- Modifications\ntags:\n- name: Modifications\n- name: General\npaths:\n  /adjustAuthorisation:\n    post:\n      tags:\n      - Modifications\n      summary: Increases or decreases the authorised amount.\n      description: 'Allows you to increase or decrease the authorised amount after\n        the initial authorisation has taken place.
