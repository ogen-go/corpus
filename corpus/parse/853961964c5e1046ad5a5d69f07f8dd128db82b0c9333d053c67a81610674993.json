These endpoints provide access to read and modify pipelines in HubSpot. Pipelines support `deals` and `tickets` object types.\n\n    When calling endpoints that take pipelineId as a parameter, that ID must correspond to an existing, un-archived pipeline. Otherwise the request will fail with a `404 Not Found` response.\n\n  x-ballerina-init-description: \u003e\n    The connector initialization requires setting the API credentials.\n  \n    Create a [HubSpot account](https://www.hubspot.com/) and obtain OAuth tokens following [this guide](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/working-with-oauth4).\n  version: v3\nservers:\n  - url: 'https://api.hubapi.com'\ntags:\n  - name: Pipelines\n  - name: Pipeline Stages\npaths:\n  '/crm/v3/pipelines/{objectType}':\n    get:\n      tags:\n        - Pipelines\n      summary: Retrieve all pipelines\n      description: 'Return all pipelines for the object type specified by `{objectType}`.'\n      operationId: 'getAll'\n      parameters:\n        - name: objectType\n          in: path\n          description: CRM object type\n          required: true\n          style: simple\n          explode: false\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - name: archived\n          in: query\n          description: Whether to return only results that have been archived.\n          required: false\n          style: form\n          explode: true\n          schema:\n            type: boolean\n            default: false\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: successful operation\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/CollectionResponsePipeline'\n        default:\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/Error'\n      security:\n        - oauth2:\n            - crm.objects.contacts.read\n            - crm.schemas.contacts.read\n            - contacts\n            - tickets\n        - hapikey: []\n    post:\n      tags:\n        - Pipelines\n      summary: Create a pipeline\n      description: 'Create a new pipeline with the provided property values.
