A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time < timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).'\n      id: Policy\n      properties:\n        bindings:\n          description: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.

For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.\n          items:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/Binding'\n          type: array\n        etag:\n          description: '`etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.

NOTE: the `name` binding allows API services to override the binding to use different resource name schemes, such as `users/*/operations`. To override the binding, API services can add a binding such as `\"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations\"` to their service configuration. For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.'\n      operationId: managedidentities.projects.locations.global.operations.list\n      parameters:\n        - description: The name of the operation's parent resource.\n          in: path\n          name: name\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: The standard list page size.\n          in: query\n          name: pageSize\n          schema:\n            type: integer\n        - description: The standard list page token.\n          in: query\n          name: pageToken\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: The standard list filter.\n          in: query\n          name: filter\n          schema:\n            type: string\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ListOperationsResponse'\n          description: Successful response\n      security:\n        - Oauth2:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n          Oauth2c:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n      tags:\n        - operations\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/key'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/alt'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/upload_protocol'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/access_token'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/prettyPrint'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/quotaUser'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/callback'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/uploadType'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/oauth_token'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/fields'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/_.xgafv'\n  /v1/projects/{projectsId}/locations/global/operations/{operationsId}:\n    delete:\n      description: Deletes a long-running operation.
