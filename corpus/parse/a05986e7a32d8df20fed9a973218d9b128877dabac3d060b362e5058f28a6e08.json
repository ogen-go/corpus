[Bulk downloads](https://www.fec.gov/data/advanced/?tab=bulk-data) are available on the current site. Information is tied to the underlying forms by file ID and image ID. Data is updated nightly. \n\n     There are a lot of data, and a good place to start is to use search to find interesting candidates and committees. Then, you can use their IDs to find report or line item details with the other endpoints. If you are interested in individual donors, check out contributor information in the `/schedule_a/` endpoints. \n\n     \u003cb class=\"body\" id=\"getting_started_head\"\u003eGetting started with the openFEC API\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \n\n     If you would like to use the FEC's API programmatically, you can sign up for your own API key using our form. Alternatively, you can still try out our API without an API key by using the web interface and using DEMO_KEY. Note that when you use the openFEC API you are subject to the [Terms of Service](https://github.com/fecgov/FEC/blob/master/TERMS-OF-SERVICE.md) and [Acceptable Use policy](https://github.com/fecgov/FEC/blob/master/ACCEPTABLE-USE-POLICY.md). \n\n     Signing up for an API key will enable you to place up to 1,000 calls an hour. Each call is limited to 100 results per page. You can email questions, comments or a request to get a key for 7,200 calls an hour (120 calls per minute) to \u003ca href=\"mailto:APIinfo@fec.gov\"\u003eAPIinfo@fec.gov\u003c/a\u003e. You can also ask questions and discuss the data in a community led [group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fec-data). \n\n     The model definitions and schema are available at [/swagger](/swagger/). This is useful for making wrappers and exploring the data. \n\n     A few restrictions limit the way you can use FEC data. For example, you can’t use contributor lists for commercial purposes or to solicit donations.

This information is organized by `candidate_id`. If you're unfamiliar with candidate IDs, using `/candidates/search/` will help you locate a particular candidate. \n\n       Officially, a candidate is an individual seeking nomination for election to a federal office. People become candidates when they (or agents working on their behalf) raise contributions or make expenditures that exceed $5,000. \n\n       The candidate endpoints primarily use data from FEC registration [Form 1](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/fecfrm1.pdf) for committee information and [Form 2](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/fecfrm2.pdf) for candidate information.\n    name: candidate\n  - description: |-\n      Committees are entities that spend and raise money in an election. Their characteristics and relationships with candidates can change over time. \n\n       You might want to use filters or search endpoints to find the committee you're looking for. Then you can use other committee endpoints to explore information about the committee that interests you. \n\n       Financial information is organized by `committee_id`, so finding the committee you're interested in will lead you to more granular financial information. \n\n       The committee endpoints include all FEC filers, even if they aren't registered as a committee. \n\n       Officially, committees include the committees and organizations that file with the FEC. Several different types of organizations file financial reports with the FEC: \n\n       *Campaign committees authorized by particular candidates to raise and spend funds in their campaigns. Non-party committees (e.g., PACs), some of which may be sponsored by corporations, unions, trade or membership groups, etc. Political party committees at the national, state, and local levels. Groups and individuals making only independent expenditures Corporations, unions, and other organizations making internal communications* \n\n       The committee endpoints primarily use data from FEC registration Form 1 and Form 2.\n    name: committee\n  - description: Reporting deadlines, election dates FEC meetings, events etc.\n    name: dates\n  - description: |-\n      Fetch key information about a committee's Form 3, Form 3X, or Form 3P financial reports. \n\n       Most committees are required to summarize their financial activity in each filing; those summaries are included in these files. Generally, committees file reports on a quarterly or monthly basis, but some must also submit a report 12 days before primary elections. Therefore, during the primary season, the period covered by this file may be different for different committees. These totals also incorporate any changes made by committees, if any report covering the period is amended. \n\n       Information is made available on the API as soon as it's processed. Keep in mind, complex paper filings take longer to process. \n\n       The financial endpoints use data from FEC [form 5](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm5.pdf), for independent expenditors; or the summary and detailed summary pages of the FEC [Form 3](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3.pdf), for House and Senate committees; [Form 3X](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3x.pdf), for PACs and parties; and [Form 3P](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3p.pdf), for presidential committees.\n    name: financial\n  - description: Search for candidates, committees by name.\n    name: search\n  - description: |-\n      All official records and reports filed by or delivered to the FEC. \n\n       Note: because the filings data includes many records, counts for large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.\n    name: filings\n  - description: |-\n      This collection of endpoints includes Schedule A records reported by a committee. Schedule A records describe itemized receipts, including contributions from individuals. If you are interested in contributions from individuals, use the /schedules/schedule_a/ endpoint.

For example, if a super PAC bought ads on TV to oppose a federal candidate, each ad purchase would be recorded here with the expenditure amount, name and id of the candidate, and whether the ad supported or opposed the candidate. \n\n       An independent expenditure is an expenditure for a communication \"expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate that is not made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate’s authorized committee, or their agents, or a political party or its agents.\" \n\n       Aggregates by candidate do not include 24 and 48 hour reports.

In odd-numbered years, the current cycle\n        is the next year — for example, in 2015, the current cycle is 2016.\n\n        For presidential and Senate candidates, multiple two-year cycles exist between elections.\n\n      parameters:\n        - description: |\n            \n            Filter records to only those that were applicable to a given\n            two-year period.The cycle begins with an odd year and is named\n            for its ending, even year.\n          explode: true\n          in: query\n          name: cycle\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            items:\n              format: int32\n              type: integer\n            type: array\n        - description: Hide null values on sorted column(s).\n          in: query\n          name: sort_hide_null\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            default: false\n            type: boolean\n        - description: For paginating through results, starting at page 1\n          in: query\n          name: page\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            default: 1\n            format: int32\n            type: integer\n        - description: The number of results returned per page.

Schedule A records describe itemized receipts, including contributions from individuals. If you are interested in contributions from an individual, use the `/schedules/schedule_a/` endpoint. For a more complete description of all Schedule A records visit [About receipts data](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/about-receipts-data/). If you are interested in our \"is_individual\" methodology visit our [methodology page](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/methodology/).\n\n        ​The `/schedules​/schedule_a​/` endpoint is not paginated by page number. This endpoint uses keyset pagination to improve query performance and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset. To request the next page, you should append the values found in the `last_indexes` object from pagination to the URL of your last request as additional parameters. \n        For example, when sorting by `contribution_receipt_date`, you might receive a page of results with the two scenarios of following pagination information:\n\n        case #1:\n        ```\n        pagination: {\n            pages: 2152643,\n            per_page: 20,\n            count: 43052850,\n            last_indexes: {\n                last_index: \"230880619\",\n                last_contribution_receipt_date: \"2014-01-01\"\n            }\n        }\n        ```\n        \u003cbr/\u003e\n        case #2 (results which include contribution_receipt_date = NULL):\n\n        ```\n        pagination: {\n            pages: 2152644,\n            per_page: 20,\n            count: 43052850,\n            last_indexes: {\n                last_index: \"230880639\",\n                sort_null_only: True\n            }\n        }\n        ```\n        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230880619` and `last_contribution_receipt_date=2014-01-01` to the URL and when reaching `contribution_receipt_date=NULL`, append `last_index=230880639` and `sort_null_only=True`. We strongly advise paging through these results using sort indices. The default sort is acending by `contribution_receipt_date` (`deprecated`, will be descending). If you do not page using sort indices, some transactions may be unintentionally filtered out.\n\n        Calls to ​`/schedules​/schedule_a​/` may return many records. For large result sets, the record counts found in the pagination object are approximate; you will need to page through the records until no records are returned.\n\n        To avoid throwing the \"out of range\" exception on the last page, one recommandation is to use total count and `per_page` to control the traverse loop of results.\n\n        ​The `/schedules​/schedule_a​/{sub_id}​/` endpoint returns a single transaction, but it does include a pagination object class. Please ignore the information in that object class.\n\n      parameters:\n        - description: Filter for all amounts less than a value.\n          in: query\n          name: max_amount\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: Employer of contributor, filers need to make an effort to gather this information\n          explode: true\n          in: query\n          name: contributor_employer\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            items:\n              type: string\n            type: array\n        - description: |\n            Provide a field to sort by.

Schedule A records describe itemized receipts, including contributions from individuals. If you are interested in contributions from an individual, use the `/schedules/schedule_a/` endpoint. For a more complete description of all Schedule A records visit [About receipts data](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/about-receipts-data/). If you are interested in our \"is_individual\" methodology visit our [methodology page](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/methodology/).\n\n        ​The `/schedules​/schedule_a​/` endpoint is not paginated by page number. This endpoint uses keyset pagination to improve query performance and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset. To request the next page, you should append the values found in the `last_indexes` object from pagination to the URL of your last request as additional parameters. \n        For example, when sorting by `contribution_receipt_date`, you might receive a page of results with the two scenarios of following pagination information:\n\n        case #1:\n        ```\n        pagination: {\n            pages: 2152643,\n            per_page: 20,\n            count: 43052850,\n            last_indexes: {\n                last_index: \"230880619\",\n                last_contribution_receipt_date: \"2014-01-01\"\n            }\n        }\n        ```\n        \u003cbr/\u003e\n        case #2 (results which include contribution_receipt_date = NULL):\n\n        ```\n        pagination: {\n            pages: 2152644,\n            per_page: 20,\n            count: 43052850,\n            last_indexes: {\n                last_index: \"230880639\",\n                sort_null_only: True\n            }\n        }\n        ```\n        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230880619` and `last_contribution_receipt_date=2014-01-01` to the URL and when reaching `contribution_receipt_date=NULL`, append `last_index=230880639` and `sort_null_only=True`. We strongly advise paging through these results using sort indices. The default sort is acending by `contribution_receipt_date` (`deprecated`, will be descending). If you do not page using sort indices, some transactions may be unintentionally filtered out.\n\n        Calls to ​`/schedules​/schedule_a​/` may return many records. For large result sets, the record counts found in the pagination object are approximate; you will need to page through the records until no records are returned.\n\n        To avoid throwing the \"out of range\" exception on the last page, one recommandation is to use total count and `per_page` to control the traverse loop of results.\n\n        ​The `/schedules​/schedule_a​/{sub_id}​/` endpoint returns a single transaction, but it does include a pagination object class. Please ignore the information in that object class.\n\n      parameters:\n        - description: Filter for all amounts less than a value.\n          in: query\n          name: max_amount\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: Employer of contributor, filers need to make an effort to gather this information\n          explode: true\n          in: query\n          name: contributor_employer\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            items:\n              type: string\n            type: array\n        - description: |\n            Provide a field to sort by.

This data\n        explains how committees and other filers spend their money. These figures are\n        reported as part of forms F3, F3X and F3P.\n\n        The data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which\n        is derived from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form. If no value is supplied, the results will\n        default to the most recent two-year period that is named after the ending,\n        even-numbered year.\n\n        Due to the large quantity of Schedule B filings, this endpoint is not paginated by\n        page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in\n        the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For\n        example, when sorting by `disbursement_date`, you might receive a page of\n        results with the following pagination information:\n\n        ```\n        pagination: {\n            pages: 965191,\n            per_page: 20,\n            count: 19303814,\n            last_indexes: {\n                last_index: \"230906248\",\n                last_disbursement_date: \"2014-07-04\"\n            }\n        }\n        ```\n\n        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230906248` and\n        `last_disbursement_date=2014-07-04` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through\n        these results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g.\n        `last_disbursement_date`), otherwise some resources may be unintentionally filtered out.\n        This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance\n        and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.\n\n        Note: because the Schedule B data includes many records, counts for\n        large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.\n      parameters:\n        - description: State of recipient\n          explode: true\n          in: query\n          name: recipient_state\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            items:\n              type: string\n            type: array\n        - description: When sorting by `disbursement_date`, this is populated with the `disbursement_date` of the last result.

This data\n        explains how committees and other filers spend their money. These figures are\n        reported as part of forms F3, F3X and F3P.\n\n        The data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which\n        is derived from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form. If no value is supplied, the results will\n        default to the most recent two-year period that is named after the ending,\n        even-numbered year.\n\n        Due to the large quantity of Schedule B filings, this endpoint is not paginated by\n        page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in\n        the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For\n        example, when sorting by `disbursement_date`, you might receive a page of\n        results with the following pagination information:\n\n        ```\n        pagination: {\n            pages: 965191,\n            per_page: 20,\n            count: 19303814,\n            last_indexes: {\n                last_index: \"230906248\",\n                last_disbursement_date: \"2014-07-04\"\n            }\n        }\n        ```\n\n        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230906248` and\n        `last_disbursement_date=2014-07-04` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through\n        these results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g.\n        `last_disbursement_date`), otherwise some resources may be unintentionally filtered out.\n        This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance\n        and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.\n\n        Note: because the Schedule B data includes many records, counts for\n        large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.\n      parameters:\n        - description: State of recipient\n          explode: true\n          in: query\n          name: recipient_state\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            items:\n              type: string\n            type: array\n        - description: When sorting by `disbursement_date`, this is populated with the `disbursement_date` of the last result.

debts\n  /schedules/schedule_e/:\n    get:\n      description: |\n        \n        Schedule E covers the line item expenditures for independent expenditures. For example, if a super PAC\n        bought ads on TV to oppose a federal candidate, each ad purchase would be recorded here with\n        the expenditure amount, name and id of the candidate, and whether the ad supported or opposed the candidate.\n\n        An independent expenditure is an expenditure for a communication \"expressly advocating the election or\n        defeat of a clearly identified candidate that is not made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with,\n        or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate’s authorized committee, or their agents, or\n        a political party or its agents.\"\n\n        Aggregates by candidate do not include 24 and 48 hour reports. This ensures we don't double count expenditures\n        and the totals are more accurate. You can still find the information from 24 and 48 hour reports in\n        `/schedule/schedule_e/`.\n\n        Due to the large quantity of Schedule E filings, this endpoint is not paginated by\n        page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in\n        the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For\n        example, when sorting by `expenditure_amount`, you might receive a page of\n        results with the following pagination information:\n\n        ```\n         \"pagination\": {\n            \"count\": 152623,\n            \"last_indexes\": {\n              \"last_index\": \"3023037\",\n              \"last_expenditure_amount\": -17348.5\n            },\n            \"per_page\": 20,\n            \"pages\": 7632\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n\n        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=3023037` and\n        `last_expenditure_amount=` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through\n        these results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date,\n        e.g. `last_disbursement_date`), otherwise some resources may be unintentionally\n        filtered out.  This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance\n        and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.\n\n        Note: because the Schedule E data includes many records, counts for\n        large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.\n      parameters:\n        - description: |\n            \n            Filter records to only those that were applicable to a given\n            two-year period.The cycle begins with an odd year and is named\n            for its ending, even year.\n          explode: true\n          in: query\n          name: cycle\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            items:\n              format: int32\n              type: integer\n            type: array\n        - description: |\n            \n            Record filed as 24- or 48-hour notice.\n          explode: true\n          in: query\n          name: is_notice\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            items:\n              type: boolean\n            type: array\n        - description: Filter for all amounts less than a value.\n          in: query\n          name: max_amount\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: |\n            \n            Selects all filings received after this date\n          in: query\n          name: min_filing_date\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            format: date\n            type: string\n        - description: |\n            Provide a field to sort by.
