A range\n        has a start key and an end key. These keys can be open or closed, indicating\n        if the range includes rows with that key. Keys are represented by lists, where\n        the ith value in the list corresponds to the ith component of the table or\n        index primary key. Individual values are encoded as described here. For example,\n        consider the following table definition: CREATE TABLE UserEvents ( UserName\n        STRING(MAX), EventDate STRING(10) ) PRIMARY KEY(UserName, EventDate); The\n        following keys name rows in this table: \"Bob\", \"2014-09-23\" Since the `UserEvents`\n        table''s `PRIMARY KEY` clause names two columns, each `UserEvents` key has\n        two elements; the first is the `UserName`, and the second is the `EventDate`.\n        Key ranges with multiple components are interpreted lexicographically by component\n        using the table or index key''s declared sort order. For example, the following\n        range returns all events for user `\"Bob\"` that occurred in the year 2015:\n        \"start_closed\": [\"Bob\", \"2015-01-01\"] \"end_closed\": [\"Bob\", \"2015-12-31\"]\n        Start and end keys can omit trailing key components. This affects the inclusion\n        and exclusion of rows that exactly match the provided key components: if the\n        key is closed, then rows that exactly match the provided components are included;\n        if the key is open, then rows that exactly match are not included. For example,\n        the following range includes all events for `\"Bob\"` that occurred during and\n        after the year 2000: \"start_closed\": [\"Bob\", \"2000-01-01\"] \"end_closed\": [\"Bob\"]\n        The next example retrieves all events for `\"Bob\"`: \"start_closed\": [\"Bob\"]\n        \"end_closed\": [\"Bob\"] To retrieve events before the year 2000: \"start_closed\":\n        [\"Bob\"] \"end_open\": [\"Bob\", \"2000-01-01\"] The following range includes all\n        rows in the table: \"start_closed\": [] \"end_closed\": [] This range returns\n        all users whose `UserName` begins with any character from A to C: \"start_closed\":\n        [\"A\"] \"end_open\": [\"D\"] This range returns all users whose `UserName` begins\n        with B: \"start_closed\": [\"B\"] \"end_open\": [\"C\"] Key ranges honor column sort\n        order. For example, suppose a table is defined as follows: CREATE TABLE DescendingSortedTable\n        { Key INT64, ... ) PRIMARY KEY(Key DESC); The following range retrieves all\n        rows with key values between 1 and 100 inclusive: \"start_closed\": [\"100\"]\n        \"end_closed\": [\"1\"] Note that 100 is passed as the start, and 1 is passed\n        as the end, because `Key` is a descending column in the schema.'\n      properties:\n        endClosed:\n          description: If the end is closed, then the range includes all rows whose\n            first `len(end_closed)` key columns exactly match `end_closed`.\n          items: {}\n          type: array\n        endOpen:\n          description: If the end is open, then the range excludes rows whose first\n            `len(end_open)` key columns exactly match `end_open`.\n          items: {}\n          type: array\n        startClosed:\n          description: If the start is closed, then the range includes all rows whose\n            first `len(start_closed)` key columns exactly match `start_closed`.\n          items: {}\n          type: array\n        startOpen:\n          description: If the start is open, then the range excludes rows whose first\n            `len(start_open)` key columns exactly match `start_open`.\n          items: {}\n          type: array\n      type: object\n    KeyRangeInfo:\n      description: A message representing information for a key range (possibly one\n        key).\n      properties:\n        contextValues:\n          description: The list of context values for this key range.\n          items:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ContextValue'\n          type: array\n        endKeyIndex:\n          description: The index of the end key in indexed_keys.\n          format: int32\n          type: integer\n        info:\n          $ref: '#/components/schemas/LocalizedString'\n          description: Information about this key range, for all metrics.\n        keysCount:\n          description: The number of keys this range covers.\n          format: int64\n          type: string\n        metric:\n          $ref: '#/components/schemas/LocalizedString'\n          description: The name of the metric. e.g. \"latency\".\n        startKeyIndex:\n          description: The index of the start key in indexed_keys.\n          format: int32\n          type: integer\n        timeOffset:\n          description: The time offset.

Every N complete values defines a row, where\n            N is equal to the number of entries in metadata.row_type.fields. Most\n            values are encoded based on type as described here. It is possible that\n            the last value in values is \"chunked\", meaning that the rest of the value\n            is sent in subsequent `PartialResultSet`(s).

If the last element in a\n            list is a `string`, `list`, or `object`, merge it with the first element\n            in the next list by applying these rules recursively. * `object`: concatenate\n            the (field name, field value) pairs. If a field name is duplicated, then\n            apply these rules recursively to merge the field values.

[2, 3], [4] =\u003e [2, 3, 4] # Lists are\n            concatenated, but the last and first elements are merged # because they\n            are strings.

Recursively,\n            the last and first elements # of the inner lists are merged because they\n            are strings.

A `Policy` is a collection of\n        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single\n        `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups,\n        and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each\n        `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some\n        types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`,\n        which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the\n        expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes\n        of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions\n        in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).\n        **JSON example:** { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\",\n        \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\",\n        \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\":\n        \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\"\n        ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant\n        access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time \u003c timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'')\",\n        } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings:\n        - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com\n        - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\n        - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\n        condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after\n        Sep 2020 expression: request.time \u003c timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'')\n        etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see\n        the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).'\n      properties:\n        bindings:\n          description: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.\n            Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the\n            `bindings` are applied.

This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a\n            policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional\n            role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy\n            * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy\n            that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you\n            must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`.

After the active transaction\n        is completed, the session can immediately be re-used for the next transaction.\n        It is not necessary to create a new session for each transaction. Transaction\n        Modes: Cloud Spanner supports three transaction modes: 1. Locking read-write.\n        This type of transaction is the only way to write data into Cloud Spanner.\n        These transactions rely on pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase\n        commit. Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the application\n        to retry. 2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed\n        consistency across several reads, but does not allow writes. Snapshot read-only\n        transactions can be configured to read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot\n        read-only transactions do not need to be committed. 3. Partitioned DML. This\n        type of transaction is used to execute a single Partitioned DML statement.\n        Partitioned DML partitions the key space and runs the DML statement over each\n        partition in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit independently.\n        Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be committed. For transactions\n        that only read, snapshot read-only transactions provide simpler semantics\n        and are almost always faster. In particular, read-only transactions do not\n        take locks, so they do not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence\n        of not taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.\n        Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They may, however,\n        read/write data in different tables within that database. Locking Read-Write\n        Transactions: Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write\n        data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally consistent.\n        Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction is active.\n        Faster transactions commit with higher probability and cause less contention.\n        Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks active as long as the transaction\n        continues to do reads, and the transaction has not been terminated by Commit\n        or Rollback. Long periods of inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner\n        to release a transaction''s locks and abort it. Conceptually, a read-write\n        transaction consists of zero or more reads or SQL statements followed by Commit.\n        At any time before Commit, the client can send a Rollback request to abort\n        the transaction. Semantics: Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all\n        read locks it acquired are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire\n        write locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any\n        reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees that\n        the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner. Unless the\n        transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about how long the\n        transaction''s locks were held for. It is an error to use Cloud Spanner locks\n        for any sort of mutual exclusion other than between Cloud Spanner transactions\n        themselves. Retrying Aborted Transactions: When a transaction aborts, the\n        application can choose to retry the whole transaction again. To maximize the\n        chances of successfully committing the retry, the client should execute the\n        retry in the same session as the original attempt. The original session''s\n        lock priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each attempt\n        has a slightly better chance of success than the previous. Under some circumstances\n        (for example, many transactions attempting to modify the same row(s)), a transaction\n        can abort many times in a short period before successfully committing. Thus,\n        it is not a good idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;\n        instead, it is better to limit the total amount of time spent retrying. Idle\n        Transactions: A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads\n        or SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10\n        seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they don''t\n        hold on to locks indefinitely. If an idle transaction is aborted, the commit\n        will fail with error `ABORTED`. If this behavior is undesirable, periodically\n        executing a simple SQL query in the transaction (for example, `SELECT 1`)\n        prevents the transaction from becoming idle. Snapshot Read-Only Transactions:\n        Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than locking read-write\n        transactions for doing several consistent reads. However, this type of transaction\n        does not support writes. Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead,\n        they work by choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads\n        at that timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block concurrent\n        read-write transactions. Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot\n        read-only transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read timestamp\n        is garbage collected; however, the default garbage collection policy is generous\n        enough that most applications do not need to worry about this in practice.\n        Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call Commit or Rollback (and\n        in fact are not permitted to do so). To execute a snapshot transaction, the\n        client specifies a timestamp bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose\n        a read timestamp. The types of timestamp bound are: - Strong (the default).\n        - Bounded staleness. - Exact staleness. If the Cloud Spanner database to be\n        read is geographically distributed, stale read-only transactions can execute\n        more quickly than strong or read-write transaction, because they are able\n        to execute far from the leader replica. Each type of timestamp bound is discussed\n        in detail below. Strong: Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of\n        all transactions that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore,\n        all rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if any\n        part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the transaction.\n        Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only transactions\n        might return inconsistent results if there are concurrent writes. If consistency\n        across reads is required, the reads should be executed within a transaction\n        or at an exact read timestamp. See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong. Exact\n        Staleness: These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified timestamp.\n        Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent prefix of the global\n        transaction history: they observe modifications done by all transactions with\n        a commit timestamp less than or equal to the read timestamp, and observe none\n        of the modifications done by transactions with a larger commit timestamp.\n        They will block until all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit\n        timestamps \u003c= the read timestamp have finished. The timestamp can either be\n        expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit timestamp or a staleness relative\n        to the current time. These modes do not require a \"negotiation phase\" to pick\n        a timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the equivalent\n        boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand, boundedly stale reads\n        usually return fresher results. See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp\n        and TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness. Bounded Staleness: Bounded\n        staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp, subject to\n        a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the newest timestamp\n        within the staleness bound that allows execution of the reads at the closest\n        available replica without blocking. All rows yielded are consistent with each\n        other -- if any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the\n        read see the transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale\n        reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at different\n        timestamps and thus return inconsistent results. Boundedly stale reads execute\n        in two phases: the first phase negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed\n        to serve the read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated\n        timestamp. As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads\n        are usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness reads. However,\n        they are typically able to return fresher results, and are more likely to\n        execute at the closest replica. Because the timestamp negotiation requires\n        up-front knowledge of which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use\n        read-only transactions. See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and\n        TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp. Old Read Timestamps and Garbage\n        Collection: Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten\n        data in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known as\n        \"version GC\". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they are one\n        hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads at read timestamps\n        more than one hour in the past. This restriction also applies to in-progress\n        reads and/or SQL queries whose timestamp become too old while executing. Reads\n        and SQL queries with too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.\n        Partitioned DML Transactions: Partitioned DML transactions are used to execute\n        DML statements with a different execution strategy that provides different,\n        and often better, scalability properties for large, table-wide operations\n        than DML in a ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements, such as an\n        OLTP workload, should prefer using ReadWrite transactions. Partitioned DML\n        partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each partition in separate,\n        internal transactions. These transactions commit automatically when complete,\n        and run independently from one another. To reduce lock contention, this execution\n        strategy only acquires read locks on rows that match the WHERE clause of the\n        statement. Additionally, the smaller per-partition transactions hold locks\n        for less time. That said, Partitioned DML is not a drop-in replacement for\n        standard DML used in ReadWrite transactions. - The DML statement must be fully-partitionable.\n        Specifically, the statement must be expressible as the union of many statements\n        which each access only a single row of the table. - The statement is not applied\n        atomically to all rows of the table. Rather, the statement is applied atomically\n        to partitions of the table, in independent transactions. Secondary index rows\n        are updated atomically with the base table rows. - Partitioned DML does not\n        guarantee exactly-once execution semantics against a partition. The statement\n        will be applied at least once to each partition. It is strongly recommended\n        that the DML statement should be idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For\n        instance, it is potentially dangerous to run a statement such as `UPDATE table\n        SET column = column + 1` as it could be run multiple times against some rows.\n        - The partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for Commit\n        or Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing the ExecuteSql\n        call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement executed on them\n        successfully. It is also possible that statement was never executed against\n        other rows. - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain the execution\n        of a single DML statement via ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql. - If any\n        error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML operation\n        (for instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation, division by zero, or a value that\n        cannot be stored due to schema constraints), then the operation is stopped\n        at that point and an error is returned. It is possible that at this point,\n        some partitions have been committed (or even committed multiple times), and\n        other partitions have not been run at all. Given the above, Partitioned DML\n        is good fit for large, database-wide, operations that are idempotent, such\n        as deleting old rows from a very large table.'\n      properties:\n        partitionedDml:\n          $ref: '#/components/schemas/PartitionedDml'\n          description: Partitioned DML transaction.
