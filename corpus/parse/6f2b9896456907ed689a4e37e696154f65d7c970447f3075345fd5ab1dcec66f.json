Username and password are combined into a string `username:password`\n    1. The resulting string is then encoded using Base64 encoding\n    1. The authorization method and a space i.e. \"Basic \" is then put before the encoded string.\n\n    For example, if the user uses `Aladdin` as the username and `open sesame` as the password then the header is formed as follows:\n\n    `Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==`\n\n    ### PHP Authentication Header Example (using cURL)\n\n    `curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, ['Authorization: Basic ' . base64_encode(\"$username:$password\")]);`\n\n    # Verbs\n\n    The API uses restful verbs.\n\n    | Verb | Description |\n    |---|---|\n    | `GET` | Select one or more items. Success returns `200` status code. |\n    | `POST` | Create a new item. Success returns `200` status code. |\n    | `PUT` | Update an item. Success returns `200` status code. |\n    | `DELETE` | Delete an item. Success returns `200` status code. |\n\n    # Status Codes\n\n    The API will respond with one of the following HTTP status codes.\n\n    | Code | Response | Description |\n    |---|---|---|\n    | `200` | `SUCCESS` | Request completed successfully. |\n    | `400` | `BAD_REQUEST` | The request was invalid or cannot be otherwise served. An accompanying error message will explain further. |\n    | `401` | `UNAUTHORIZED` | Authentication credentials were missing or incorrect. |\n    | `403` | `FORBIDDEN` | The request is understood, but it has been refused or access is not allowed. An accompanying error message will explain why. |\n    | `404` | `NOT_FOUND` | The URI requested is invalid or the resource requested does not exists. |\n    | `405` | `NOT_FOUND` | Method doesn't exist or is not allowed. |\n    | `429` | `TOO_MANY_REQUESTS` | Rate Limit Exceeded. Returned when a request cannot be served due to the application’s rate limit having been exhausted for the resource. See Rate Limiting. |\n    | `500` | `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` | Something is broken |\n\n    # Application Status Codes\n\n    The following status codes can be returned in addition to the HTTP status code. For example, when using the Send SMS endpoint:\n\n    | Response | Description |\n    |---|---|\n    | `SUCCESS` | Message added to queue OK. Use delivery reports to get an update on the delivery status.|\n    | `MISSING_CREDENTIALS` | Not enough information has been supplied for authentication.

For example:\n\n    `/subaccounts?q=field:value,field2:value`\n\n    ## Order\n\n    To perform a sort, add `order_by` as a query parameter. For example:\n\n    `/subaccounts?order_by=field:desc/asc`\n\n    ## AND / OR\n\n    By default, it will search using the `AND` operator. This can be set using `operator` as a query parameter. For example:\n\n    `/subaccounts?q=field:value\u0026operator=OR`\n\n    **Options:**\n\n    - `AN` - returns results matching **all** query fields specified\n\n    - `OR` - returns results matching **any** query fields specified\n\n    ## Example\n\n    `/subaccounts?q=first_name:john,last_name:smith\u0026order_by=subaccount_id:asc\u0026operator=AND`\n\n    # CORS\n\n    When creating your API app, specify the JavaScript (CORS) origins you'll be using. We use these origins to return the headers needed for CORS.\n\n    # Date and Time\n\n    All date/timestamps will be returned in Unix time (also known as POSIX time or erroneously as Epoch time) with no leap seconds.\n\n    For example: `1435255816`\n\n    ```\n    (ISO 8601: 2015-06-25T18:10:16Z)\n    ```\n\n    More information: [Wikipedia: Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).\n\n    There is ony one Unix time and it is created by using the UTC/GMT time zone. This means you might have convert time zones to calculate timestamps. Most programming language have libraries to help you converting time zones.\n\n    **The current Unix time can be found here:** [Epoch Converter](http://www.epochconverter.com)\n\n    # Testing\n\n    ## Test Credentials\n\n    These API credentials can be used to test specific scenarios.\n\n    **Note:** you will need to create a free account to test other scenarios.

You can send to a mix of contacts and contact lists, as long as the total number of recipients is up to 1000. The response contains a status and details for each recipient.\n\n      Refer to [**Application Status Codes**](#introduction/application-status-codes) for the possible response message status strings.\n\n      # How many characters can I send in a message?\n\n      ## Standard MMS Message\n\n      1500 characters\n\n      ## Unicode MMS Message\n\n      500 characters\n\n      If a message is longer the allowed number of characters it will be truncated. If a message contains any characters that aren't in the GSM 03.38 character set, the message type will be treated as unicode. (`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_03.38`)\n\n      # Maximum File Size\n\n      You can send a single attachment with a size of up to 250 kB. Some older devices can only accept attachments with up to 30 kB.\n\n      # Supported File Types\n\n      - Supported file types are listed below. If you need to convert a file to a supported format, it can be first passed to our uploads endpoint: `/uploads?convert=mms`\n\n      - This will return a URL to the converted image file that can be used in the /mms/send endpoint.\n\n      - Contact us to add support for any other file type.\n\n      ## Images\n\n      | File type | Required to be passed to uploads endpoint first? |\n      |---|---|\n      | jpg | No |\n      | gif | No |\n      | jpeg | Yes |\n      | png | Yes |\n      | bmp | Yes |\n    name: MMS\n  - name: Numbers\n  - name: Pricing\n  - name: Post Address Detection\n  - name: Post Direct Mail\n  - name: Post Letter\n  - name: Postcards\n  - name: Referral Accounts\n  - name: Reseller\n  - name: Reseller Accounts\n  - name: SDK\n  - name: Search\n  - description: |-\n      # How many messages can I send?\n\n      ## Send SMS Endpoint\n\n      You can post **up to 1000 messages** with each API call. You can send to a mix of contacts and contact lists, as long as the total number of recipients is up to 1000. The response contains a status and details for each recipient.\n\n      Refer to [**Application Status Codes**](#introduction/application-status-codes) for the possible response message status strings.\n\n      ## SMS Campaign Endpoint\n\n      You can post to a list with **up to 20000 recipients** with each API call. You can only send to a single list containing up to 20,000 recipients. The response is far less detailed than the normal Send SMS endpoint.\n\n      # How many characters can I send in a message?\n\n      A standard SMS message has a maximum of 160 characters. Longer messages are definitely possible, however please be aware that exceeding 160 characters will constitute a ‘second’ message. The end user will see this as 1 long message on their handset.\n      When a message is longer than 160 characters, this is referred to as a multi-part message as it contains multiple messages (or multiple-parts). The total SMS limit then becomes 153 characters per ‘part’ as the 7 characters are used up by invisible headers and footers which denote which part of the message is being sent (i.e. Part 1 of 2). For example:\n      If a message is longer than 6 message parts, it will be truncated (see below). If a message contains any characters that aren't in the GSM 03.38 character set, the message type will be treated as unicode.

Contact us to add support for any other file type. If you're using `docx` or `doc` files, you'll need to convert the file first using our uploads endpoint with the querystring parameter `convert=post` e.g. `POST /uploads?convert=post`. This will return a URL to the converted pdf file that can be used in the `/post/letters/send` endpoint.\n\n        **Letter File Options**\n\n        **Use existing URL**\n\n        With this option, you can use an existing URL to a `pdf` document. For example, you might generate the `pdf` on your server.\n\n        **Upload File to Our Server**\n\n        With this option, you can use the `/uploads` endpoint to upload the document. The `/uploads` endpoint returns a URL that can be used in the `/post/letters/send` endpoint.\n      operationId: Send Post Letter\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              example:\n                colour: 1\n                duplex: 0\n                file_url: http://yourdomain.com/file.pdf\n                priority_post: 0\n                recipients:\n                  -
