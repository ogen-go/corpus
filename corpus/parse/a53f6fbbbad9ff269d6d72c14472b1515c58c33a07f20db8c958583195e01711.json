For example, if the original string is 500 bytes long and the limit of the string is 128 bytes, then `value` contains the first 128 bytes of the 500-byte string. Truncation always happens on a UTF8 character boundary. If there are multi-byte characters in the string, then the length of the shortened string might be less than the size limit.\n          type: string\n      type: object\n  securitySchemes:\n    Oauth2:\n      description: Oauth 2.0 implicit authentication\n      flows:\n        implicit:\n          authorizationUrl: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth\n          scopes:\n            https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform: See, edit, configure, and delete your Google Cloud data and see the email address for your Google Account.\n            https://www.googleapis.com/auth/trace.append: Write Trace data for a project or application\n      type: oauth2\n    Oauth2c:\n      description: Oauth 2.0 authorization code authentication\n      flows:\n        authorizationCode:\n          authorizationUrl: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth\n          scopes:\n            https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform: See, edit, configure, and delete your Google Cloud data and see the email address for your Google Account.\n            https://www.googleapis.com/auth/trace.append: Write Trace data for a project or application\n          tokenUrl: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token\n      type: oauth2\n  x-stackQL-resources:\n    spans_span:\n      id: google.cloudtrace.spans_span\n      name: spans_span\n      title: Spans_span\n      methods:\n        projects_traces_spans_createSpan:\n          operation:\n            $ref: '#/paths/~1v2~1projects~1{projectsId}~1traces~1{tracesId}~1spans~1{spansId}/post'\n          response:\n            mediaType: application/json\n            openAPIDocKey: '200'\n      sqlVerbs:\n        select: []\n        insert:\n          - $ref: '#/components/x-stackQL-resources/spans_span/methods/projects_traces_spans_createSpan'\n        update: []\n        delete: []\n    traces:\n      id: google.cloudtrace.traces\n      name: traces\n      title: Traces\n      methods:\n        projects_traces_batchWrite:\n          operation:\n            $ref: '#/paths/~1v2~1projects~1{projectsId}~1traces:batchWrite/post'\n          response:\n            mediaType: application/json\n            openAPIDocKey: '200'\n      sqlVerbs:\n        select: []\n        insert: []\n        update: []\n        delete: []\nexternalDocs:\n  url: https://cloud.google.com/trace\ninfo:\n  description: 'Sends application trace data to Cloud Trace for viewing.
