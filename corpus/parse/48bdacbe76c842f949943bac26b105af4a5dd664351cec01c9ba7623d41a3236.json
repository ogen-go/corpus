For other buildings see below building=farm_auxiliary, building=barn, â€¦ If in your country farmhouse looks same as general residential house then you can tag as building=house as well. See also landuse=farmyard for the surrounding area \n\n        ### Agricultural/Plant production\n        \n        -   `barn` -  An agricultural building used for storage and as a covered workplace. \n        -   `conservatory` -  A building or room having glass or tarpaulin roofing and walls used as an indoor garden or a sunroom (winter garden). \n        -   `cowshed` - A cowshed (cow barn, cow house) is a building for housing cows, usually found on farms. \n        -   `farm_auxiliary` -  A building on a farm that is not a dwelling (use 'farm' or 'house' for the farm house). \n        -   `greenhouse` -  A greenhouse is a glass or plastic covered building used to grow plants. Use landuse=greenhouse_horticulture for an area containing multiple greenhouses  \n        -   `stable` -  A stable is a building where horses are kept. \n        -   `sty` - A sty (pigsty, pig ark, pig-shed) is a building for raising domestic pigs, usually found on farms.  \n              \n        ### Storage\n        \n        -   `hangar` -  A hangar is a building used for the storage of airplanes, helicopters or space-craft. Consider adding aeroway=hangar, when appropriate. \n        -   `hut` - A hut is a small and crude shelter. Note that this word has two meanings -   `it may be synonym of building=shed, it may be a residential building of low quality. \n        -   `shed` -  A shed is a simple, single-storey structure in a back garden or on an allotment that is used for storage, hobbies, or as a workshop.  \n            \n        ### Power/Technical buildings\n        \n        -   `digester` -  A digester is a bioreactor for the production of inflatable biogas from biomass.  \n        -   `service` - Service building usually is a small unmanned building with certain machinery (like pumps or transformers).  \n        -   `transformer_tower` - A transformer tower is a characteristic tall building comprising a distribution transformer and constructed to connect directly to a medium voltage overhead power line. Quite often the power line has since been undergrounded but the building may still serve as a substation. If the building is still in use as a substation it should additionally be tagged as power=substation + substation=minor_distribution.  \n        -   `water_tower` - A water tower \n        \n      type: string\n      externalDocs: \n        url: \"https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features#Building\"\n      x-ngsi: \n        uri-prefix: \"https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:building%3D\"\n\n    # Extend the existing IoT Device model to create a new type with an attribute \n    TemperatureSensor:\n      type: object\n      required:\n        -  temperature\n      allOf:\n        - $ref: https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/device.yaml#/Device\n\n      description: \u003e\n        A device that consists of a sensor, has category `saref:Sensor` and is used for the purpose of sensing temperature`.\n      \n      properties:\n        temperature:\n          $ref: https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/saref-terms.yaml#/temperature\n\n\n    # Extend the existing IoT Device model to create a new type with an attribute \n    FillingLevelSensor:\n      type: object\n      required:\n        -  FillingLevelSensor\n      allOf:\n        - $ref: https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/device.yaml#/Device\n\n      description: \u003e\n        A device that consists of a sensor, has category `saref:Sensor` and is used for the purpose of sensing filling Level.\n      \n      properties:\n        fillingLevel:\n          $ref: https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/saref-terms.yaml#/fillingLevel\n    \n\n    # This is the full list of IoT Device Categories - it remains unchanged\n    DeviceCategory: \n      $ref: \"https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/saref-terms.yaml#/Categories\"\n    \n    # This is a reduced list of context attributes measurable by  Agricultural devices\n    ControlledProperties: \n      type: string\n      x-ngsi:\n        uri-prefix: 'https://w3id.org/saref#'\n      enum:\n        - airPollution\n        - atmosphericPressure\n        - depth\n        - eatingActivity\n        - fillingLevel\n        - humidity\n        - location\n        - milking\n        - motion\n        - movementActivity\n        - occupancy\n        - precipitation\n        - pressure\n        - soilMoisture\n        - solarRadiation\n        - temperature\n        - waterConsumption\n        - weatherConditions\n        - weight\n        - windDirection\n        - windSpeed\n      description: \u003e\n          -   `airPollution`\n          -   `atmosphericPressure`\n          -   `depth`\n          -   `eatingActivity`\n          -   `fillingLevel`\n          -   `humidity`\n          -   `location`\n          -   `milking`\n          -   `motion`\n          -   `movementActivity`\n          -   `occupancy`\n          -   `precipitation`\n          -   `pressure`\n          -   `soilMoisture`\n          -   `solarRadiation`\n          -   `temperature`\n          -   `waterConsumption`\n          -   `weatherConditions`\n          -   `weight`\n          -   `windDirection`\n          -   `windSpeed`\n\n\n\n    # This is a defintion of a person - it remains unchanged\n    Person:\n      allOf:\n        - $ref: \"https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/ngsi-ld.yaml#/Common\"\n        - $ref: \"https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/schema.org.yaml#/Person\"\n    Gender:\n      $ref: \"https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.NGSI-LD/models/schema.org.yaml#/GenderType\"\ninfo: \n  description: \"Model Definitions for an Agricultural Smart System\"\n  title: Smart Agri Data Models\n  version: \"1.0.0\"\nopenapi: \"3.0.0\"\n\n\n# These paths are merely representative.\npaths: \n  /ngsi-ld/v1/entities: \n    get: \n      responses: \n        ? \"200\"\n        : \n          description:  OK\n          content: \n            application/ld+json: \n              schema: \n                type: object"
