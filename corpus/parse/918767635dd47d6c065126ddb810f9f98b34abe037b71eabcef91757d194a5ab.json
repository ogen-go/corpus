Long polling is the concept where a HTTP request is kept open until the server sends a response, then repeating the process over and over to receive updated responses.  Long polling the event stream can only be used for user events, not for enterprise events.  To use long polling, first use this endpoint to retrieve a list of long poll URLs. Next, make a long poll request to any of the provided URLs.  When an event occurs in monitored account a response with the value `new_change` will be sent. The response contains no other details as it only serves as a prompt to take further action such as sending a request to the [events endpoint](#get-events) with the last known `stream_position`.  After the server sends this response it closes the connection. You must now repeat the long poll process to begin listening for events again.  If no events occur for a while and the connection times out you will receive a response with the value `reconnect`. When you receive this response you’ll make another call to this endpoint to restart the process.  If you receive no events in `retry_timeout` seconds then you will need to make another request to the real-time server (one of the URLs in the response for this endpoint). This might be necessary due to network errors.

In general, for unpaged representations it can be replaced by an empty string.  For paged representations, replace the `{+asset_path}` with the page to request plus the extension for the file, for example `1.pdf`.  When requesting the download URL the following additional query params can be passed along.  * `set_content_disposition_type` - Sets the `Content-Disposition` header in the API response with the specified disposition type of either `inline` or `attachment`. If not supplied, the `Content-Disposition` header is not included in the response.  * `set_content_disposition_filename` - Allows the application to   define the representation''s file name used in the   `Content-Disposition` header.  If not defined, the filename   is derived from the source file name in Box combined with the   extension of the representation.'\n                          info:\n                            type: object\n                            description: An object containing the URL that can be used to fetch more info on this representation.\n                            properties:\n                              url:\n                                type: string\n                                example: 'https://api.box.com/2.0/internal_files/123/versions/345/representations/png_paged_2048x2048'\n                                description: The API URL that can be used to get more info on this file representation.
