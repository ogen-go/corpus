An FX swap agreement is a contract in which one party borrows one currency in exchange \n       of another currency and repays at the end of the contract at the contractual rate. \n\n    # Use Cases\n\n      This API covers the following use cases for **private clients** and **external asset managers**:\n\n      1. Retrieve all available information regarding current and completed orders, including their status\n\n      2. Request foreign exchange swap for a single client account \n\n      3. Request the cancellation of a not executed foreign exchange swap.\n\n    # General Remarks\n\n    * This API definition is inspired by the ISO 20022 standard messages\n      [ForeignExchangeTradeCaptureReportV01 (fxtr.031)](https://www.iso20022.org/standardsrepository/type/fxtr.031.001.01),  \n      [ForeignExchangeTradeInstructionV04 (fxtr.014)](https://www.iso20022.org/standardsrepository/type/fxtr.014.001.04) and \n      in coordination with the Bankable Assets API for Securities Orders. \n\n    * Schemas are generally based on datatype definitions with the same name in the\n      [ISO 20022 Repository](https://www.iso20022.org/standardsrepository).\n      In some cases, schemas may correspond to a restrictive version of the standard datatype definition without some\n      or all optional fields.\n      Any other deviations to the standard datatype definition are explicitly described below.\n\n    * Pagination is not described in any defined\n      [Operation Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md#operation-object).\n      A productive implementation of this API may support additional query parameters for implementing pagination\n      according to the possibilities of the underlying systems.\n      These additional query parameters must be optional and they must not clash with any parameter here defined.\n\n      To allow implementing pagination and avoid clashes, this API will not use the following parameters names\n      in this or future versions of the API: `limit`, `offset` and `cursor`.\n\n    * According to the definition of\n      [Parameter Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md#parameter-object)\n      in the OpenAPI Specification:\n      *If `in` is `\"header\"` and the `name` field is `\"Accept\"`, `\"Content-Type\"` or `\"Authorization\"`, the parameter\n      definition SHALL be ignored.* Therefore:\n      * The parameter `\"Accept\"` will not be defined in this file at any place.\n      * The parameters `\"Content-Type\"` and `\"Authorization\"` are implicitly defined by the fields `content` in\n        [Response Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md#response-object)\n        and `security` in\n        [Operation Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md#operation-object).\n\n  contact:\n    name: Open Banking Project Switzerland\n    url: https://www.openbankingproject.ch\n    email: info@obp.ch\n\nservers:\n  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  # SERVERS\n  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  -
