Never put an access\\\n    \\ token in client-side JavaScript, or embed it in a mobile application. LaunchDarkly\\\n    \\ has special mobile keys that you can embed in mobile apps.

It's\\\n    \\ designed for use in client-side JavaScript.\\n\\n### Via request header\\n\\nThe\\\n    \\ preferred way to authenticate with the API is by adding an `Authorization` header\\\n    \\ containing your access token to your requests. The value of the `Authorization`\\\n    \\ header must be your access token.\\n\\nManage personal access tokens from the\\\n    \\ [Account Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens) page.\\n\\n###\\\n    \\ Via session cookie\\n\\nFor testing purposes, you can make API calls directly\\\n    \\ from your web browser. If you're logged in to the application, the API will\\\n    \\ use your existing session to authenticate calls.\\n\\nIf you have a [role](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/team/built-in-roles)\\\n    \\ other than Admin, or have a [custom role](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/team/custom-roles)\\\n    \\ defined, you may not have permission to perform some API calls. You will receive\\\n    \\ a `401` response code in that case.\\n\\n\u003e ### Modifying the Origin header causes\\\n    \\ an error\\n\u003e\\n\u003e LaunchDarkly validates that the Origin header for any API request\\\n    \\ authenticated by a session cookie matches the expected Origin header. The expected\\\n    \\ Origin header is `https://app.launchdarkly.com`.\\n\u003e\\n\u003e If the Origin header\\\n    \\ does not match what's expected, LaunchDarkly returns an error. This error can\\\n    \\ prevent the LaunchDarkly app from working correctly.\\n\u003e\\n\u003e Any browser extension\\\n    \\ that intentionally changes the Origin header can cause this problem. For example,\\\n    \\ the `Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *` Chrome extension changes the Origin header\\\n    \\ to `http://evil.com` and causes the app to fail.\\n\u003e\\n\u003e To prevent this error,\\\n    \\ do not modify your Origin header.\\n\u003e\\n\u003e LaunchDarkly does not require origin\\\n    \\ matching when authenticating with an access token, so this issue does not affect\\\n    \\ normal API usage.\\n\\n## Representations\\n\\nAll resources expect and return JSON\\\n    \\ response bodies. Error responses will also send a JSON body. Read [Errors](#section/Errors)\\\n    \\ for a more detailed description of the error format used by the API.\\n\\nIn practice\\\n    \\ this means that you always get a response with a `Content-Type` header set to\\\n    \\ `application/json`.\\n\\nIn addition, request bodies for `PUT`, `POST`, `REPORT`\\\n    \\ and `PATCH` requests must be encoded as JSON with a `Content-Type` header set\\\n    \\ to `application/json`.\\n\\n### Summary and detailed representations\\n\\nWhen you\\\n    \\ fetch a list of resources, the response includes only the most important attributes\\\n    \\ of each resource. This is a _summary representation_ of the resource. When you\\\n    \\ fetch an individual resource, such as a single feature flag, you receive a _detailed\\\n    \\ representation_ of the resource.\\n\\nThe best way to find a detailed representation\\\n    \\ is to follow links. Every summary representation includes a link to its detailed\\\n    \\ representation.\\n\\nIn most cases, the detailed representation contains all of\\\n    \\ the attributes of the resource. In a few cases, the detailed representation\\\n    \\ contains many, but not all, of the attributes of the resource. Typically this\\\n    \\ happens when an attribute of the requested resource is itself paginated. You\\\n    \\ can request that the response include a particular attribute by using the `expand`\\\n    \\ request parameter.\\n\\n### Links and addressability\\n\\nThe best way to navigate\\\n    \\ the API is by following links. These are attributes in representations that\\\n    \\ link to other resources. The API always uses the same format for links:\\n\\n\\\n    - Links to other resources within the API are encapsulated in a `_links` object.\\n\\\n    - If the resource has a corresponding link to HTML content on the site, it is\\\n    \\ stored in a special `_site` link.\\n\\nEach link has two attributes: an href (the\\\n    \\ URL) and a type (the content type). For example, a feature resource might return\\\n    \\ the following:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"_links\\\": {\\n    \\\"parent\\\": {\\n      \\\"href\\\"\\\n    : \\\"/api/features\\\",\\n      \\\"type\\\": \\\"application/json\\\"\\n    },\\n    \\\"self\\\"\\\n    : {\\n      \\\"href\\\": \\\"/api/features/sort.order\\\",\\n      \\\"type\\\": \\\"application/json\\\"\\\n    \\n    }\\n  },\\n  \\\"_site\\\": {\\n    \\\"href\\\": \\\"/features/sort.order\\\",\\n    \\\"\\\n    type\\\": \\\"text/html\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFrom this, you can navigate to the parent\\\n    \\ collection of features by following the `parent` link, or navigate to the site\\\n    \\ page for the feature by following the `_site` link.\\n\\nCollections are always\\\n    \\ represented as a JSON object with an `items` attribute containing an array of\\\n    \\ representations. Like all other representations, collections have `_links` defined\\\n    \\ at the top level.\\n\\nPaginated collections include `first`, `last`, `next`,\\\n    \\ and `prev` links containing a URL with the respective set of elements in the\\\n    \\ collection.\\n\\n### Expanding responses\\n\\nSometimes the detailed representation\\\n    \\ of a resource does not include all of the attributes of the resource by default.\\\n    \\ If this is the case, the request method will clearly document this and describe\\\n    \\ which attributes you can include in an expanded response.\\n\\nTo include the\\\n    \\ additional attributes, append the `expand` request parameter to your request\\\n    \\ and add a comma-separated list of the attributes to include. For example, when\\\n    \\ you append `?expand=members,roles` to the [Get team](/tag/Teams-(beta)#operation/getTeam)\\\n    \\ endpoint, the expanded response includes both of these attributes.\\n\\n## Updates\\n\\\n    \\nResources that accept partial updates use the `PATCH` verb. Most resources support\\\n    \\ the [JSON Patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) format. Some\\\n    \\ resources also support the [JSON Merge Patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386)\\\n    \\ format, and some resources support the [semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch)\\\n    \\ format, which is a way to specify the modifications to perform as a set of executable\\\n    \\ instructions. Each resource supports optional [comments](/reference#updates-with-comments)\\\n    \\ that you can submit with updates. Comments appear in outgoing webhooks, the\\\n    \\ audit log, and other integrations.\\n\\n### Updates using JSON patch\\n\\n[JSON\\\n    \\ Patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) is a way to specify the\\\n    \\ modifications to perform on a resource. JSON patch uses paths and a limited\\\n    \\ set of operations to describe how to transform the current state of the resource\\\n    \\ into a new state. JSON patch documents are always arrays, where each element\\\n    \\ contains an operation, a path to the field to update, and the new value.\\n\\n\\\n    For example, in this feature flag representation:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"name\\\"\\\n    : \\\"New recommendations engine\\\",\\n    \\\"key\\\": \\\"engine.enable\\\",\\n    \\\"description\\\"\\\n    : \\\"This is the description\\\",\\n    ...\\n}\\n```\\nYou can change the feature flag's\\\n    \\ description with the following patch document:\\n\\n```json\\n[{ \\\"op\\\": \\\"replace\\\"\\\n    , \\\"path\\\": \\\"/description\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"This is the new description\\\" }]\\n\\\n    ```\\n\\nYou can specify multiple modifications to perform in a single request.\\\n    \\ You can also test that certain preconditions are met before applying the patch:\\n\\\n    \\n```json\\n[\\n  { \\\"op\\\": \\\"test\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/version\\\", \\\"value\\\": 10 },\\n\\\n    \\  { \\\"op\\\": \\\"replace\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/description\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"The new description\\\"\\\n    \\ }\\n]\\n```\\n\\nThe above patch request tests whether the feature flag's `version`\\\n    \\ is `10`, and if so, changes the feature flag's description.\\n\\nAttributes that\\\n    \\ aren't editable, like a resource's `_links`, have names that start with an underscore.\\n\\\n    \\n### Updates using JSON merge patch\\n\\n[JSON merge patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386)\\\n    \\ is another format for specifying the modifications to perform on a resource.\\\n    \\ JSON merge patch is less expressive than JSON patch but in many cases, it is\\\n    \\ simpler to construct a merge patch document. For example, you can change a feature\\\n    \\ flag's description with the following merge patch document:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n\\\n    \\  \\\"description\\\": \\\"New flag description\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Updates using semantic\\\n    \\ patch\\n\\nThe API also supports the semantic patch format. A semantic `PATCH`\\\n    \\ is a way to specify the modifications to perform on a resource as a set of executable\\\n    \\ instructions.\\n\\nSemantic patch allows you to be explicit about intent using\\\n    \\ precise, custom instructions. In many cases, you can define semantic patch instructions\\\n    \\ independently of the current state of the resource. This can be useful when\\\n    \\ defining a change that may be applied at a future date.\\n\\nTo make a semantic\\\n    \\ patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to\\\n    \\ your `Content-Type` header.\\n\\nHere's how:\\n\\n```\\nContent-Type: application/json;\\\n    \\ domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch\\n```\\n\\nIf you call a semantic patch\\\n    \\ resource without this header, you will receive a `400` response because your\\\n    \\ semantic patch will be interpreted as a JSON patch.\\n\\nThe body of a semantic\\\n    \\ patch request takes the following properties:\\n\\n* `comment` (string): (Optional)\\\n    \\ A description of the update.\\n* `environmentKey` (string): (Required for some\\\n    \\ resources only) The environment key.\\n* `instructions` (array): (Required) A\\\n    \\ list of actions the update should perform. Each action in the list must be an\\\n    \\ object with a `kind` property that indicates the instruction. If the action\\\n    \\ requires parameters, you must include those parameters as additional fields\\\n    \\ in the object. The documentation for each resource that supports semantic patch\\\n    \\ includes the available instructions and any additional parameters.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\\n    \\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"comment\\\": \\\"optional comment\\\",\\n  \\\"instructions\\\": [ {\\\"\\\n    kind\\\": \\\"turnFlagOn\\\"} ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf any instruction in the patch encounters\\\n    \\ an error, the endpoint returns an error and will not change the resource. In\\\n    \\ general, each instruction silently does nothing if the resource is already in\\\n    \\ the state you request.\\n\\n\u003e ### Supported semantic patch API endpoints\\n\u003e\\n\\\n    \u003e - [Patch experiment](/tag/Experiments-(beta)#operation/patchExperiment)\\n\u003e -\\\n    \\ [Patch segment](/tag/Segments#operation/patchSegment)\\n\u003e - [Update feature flag](/tag/Feature-flags#operation/patchFeatureFlag)\\n\\\n    \u003e - [Update flag trigger](/tag/Flag-triggers#operation/patchTriggerWorkflow)\\n\\\n    \u003e - [Update expiring user targets on feature flag](/tag/Feature-flags#operation/patchExpiringUserTargets)\\n\\\n    \u003e - [Update expiring user target for flags](/tag/User-settings#operation/patchExpiringFlagsForUser)\\n\\\n    \u003e - [Update expiring user targets for segment](/tag/Segments#operation/patchExpiringUserTargetsForSegment)\\n\\\n    \u003e - [Update scheduled changes workflow](/tag/Scheduled-changes#operation/patchFlagConfigScheduledChange)\\n\\\n    \u003e - [Update team](/tag/Teams-(beta)#operation/patchTeam)\\n\\n### Updates with comments\\n\\\n    \\nYou can submit optional comments with `PATCH` changes.\\n\\nTo submit a comment\\\n    \\ along with a JSON Patch document, use the following format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n\\\n    \\  \\\"comment\\\": \\\"This is a comment string\\\",\\n  \\\"patch\\\": [{ \\\"op\\\": \\\"replace\\\"\\\n    , \\\"path\\\": \\\"/description\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"The new description\\\" }]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\\n    To submit a comment along with a JSON merge patch document, use the following\\\n    \\ format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"comment\\\": \\\"This is a comment string\\\",\\n  \\\"merge\\\"\\\n    : { \\\"description\\\": \\\"New flag description\\\" }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTo submit a comment\\\n    \\ along with a semantic patch, use the following format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"comment\\\"\\\n    : \\\"This is a comment string\\\",\\n  \\\"instructions\\\": [ {\\\"kind\\\": \\\"turnFlagOn\\\"\\\n    } ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Errors\\n\\nThe API always returns errors in a common format.\\\n    \\ Here's an example:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"code\\\": \\\"invalid_request\\\",\\n  \\\"message\\\"\\\n    : \\\"A feature with that key already exists\\\",\\n  \\\"id\\\": \\\"30ce6058-87da-11e4-b116-123b93f75cba\\\"\\\n    \\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe general class of error is indicated by the `code`. The `message`\\\n    \\ is a human-readable explanation of what went wrong.

For more information\\\n    \\ on CORS, see the [CORS W3C Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors). Example\\\n    \\ CORS headers might look like:\\n\\n```http\\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Accept,\\\n    \\ Content-Type, Content-Length, Accept-Encoding, Authorization\\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods:\\\n    \\ OPTIONS, GET, DELETE, PATCH\\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\\nAccess-Control-Max-Age:\\\n    \\ 300\\n```\\n\\nYou can make authenticated CORS calls just as you would make same-origin\\\n    \\ calls, using either [token or session-based authentication](#section/Authentication).\\\n    \\ If you’re using session auth, you should set the `withCredentials` property\\\n    \\ for your `xhr` request to `true`. You should never expose your access tokens\\\n    \\ to untrusted users.\\n\\n## Rate limiting\\n\\nWe use several rate limiting strategies\\\n    \\ to ensure the availability of our APIs. Rate-limited calls to our APIs will\\\n    \\ return a `429` status code. Calls to our APIs will include headers indicating\\\n    \\ the current rate limit status. The specific headers returned depend on the API\\\n    \\ route being called. The limits differ based on the route, authentication mechanism,\\\n    \\ and other factors. Routes that are not rate limited may not contain any of the\\\n    \\ headers described below.\\n\\n\u003e ### Rate limiting and SDKs\\n\u003e\\n\u003e LaunchDarkly\\\n    \\ SDKs are never rate limited and do not use the API endpoints defined here. LaunchDarkly\\\n    \\ uses a different set of approaches, including streaming/server-sent events and\\\n    \\ a global CDN, to ensure availability to the routes used by LaunchDarkly SDKs.\\n\\\n    \\n### Global rate limits\\n\\nAuthenticated requests are subject to a global limit.\\\n    \\ This is the maximum number of calls that can be made to the API per ten seconds.\\\n    \\ All personal access tokens on the account share this limit, so exceeding the\\\n    \\ limit with one access token will impact other tokens. Calls that are subject\\\n    \\ to global rate limits will return the headers below:\\n\\n| Header name      \\\n    \\              | Description                                                 \\\n    \\                     |\\n| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\n    \\ |\\n| `X-Ratelimit-Global-Remaining` | The maximum number of requests the account\\\n    \\ is permitted to make per ten seconds. |\\n| `X-Ratelimit-Reset`            |\\\n    \\ The time at which the current rate limit window resets in epoch milliseconds.\\\n    \\    |\\n\\nWe do not publicly document the specific number of calls that can be\\\n    \\ made globally. This limit may change, and we encourage clients to program against\\\n    \\ the specification, relying on the two headers defined above, rather than hardcoding\\\n    \\ to the current limit.\\n\\n### Route-level rate limits\\n\\nSome authenticated routes\\\n    \\ have custom rate limits. These also reset every ten seconds. Any access tokens\\\n    \\ hitting the same route share this limit, so exceeding the limit with one access\\\n    \\ token may impact other tokens. Calls that are subject to route-level rate limits\\\n    \\ will return the headers below:\\n\\n| Header name                   | Description\\\n    \\                                                                            \\\n    \\               |\\n| ----------------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\n    \\ |\\n| `X-Ratelimit-Route-Remaining` | The maximum number of requests to the current\\\n    \\ route the account is permitted to make per ten seconds. |\\n| `X-Ratelimit-Reset`\\\n    \\           | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in epoch\\\n    \\ milliseconds.                         |\\n\\nA _route_ represents a specific URL\\\n    \\ pattern and verb. For example, the [Delete environment](/tag/Environments#operation/deleteEnvironment)\\\n    \\ endpoint is considered a single route, and each call to delete an environment\\\n    \\ counts against your route-level rate limit for that route.\\n\\nWe do not publicly\\\n    \\ document the specific number of calls that can be made to each endpoint per\\\n    \\ ten seconds. These limits may change, and we encourage clients to program against\\\n    \\ the specification, relying on the two headers defined above, rather than hardcoding\\\n    \\ to the current limits.\\n\\n### IP-based rate limiting\\n\\nWe also employ IP-based\\\n    \\ rate limiting on some API routes. If you hit an IP-based rate limit, your API\\\n    \\ response will include a `Retry-After` header indicating how long to wait before\\\n    \\ re-trying the call. Clients must wait at least `Retry-After` seconds before\\\n    \\ making additional calls to our API, and should employ jitter and backoff strategies\\\n    \\ to avoid triggering rate limits again.\\n\\n## OpenAPI (Swagger)\\n\\nWe have a\\\n    \\ [complete OpenAPI (Swagger) specification](https://app.launchdarkly.com/api/v2/openapi.json)\\\n    \\ for our API.\\n\\nYou can use this specification to generate client libraries\\\n    \\ to interact with our REST API in your language of choice.\\n\\nThis specification\\\n    \\ is supported by several API-based tools such as Postman and Insomnia. In many\\\n    \\ cases, you can directly import our specification to ease use in navigating the\\\n    \\ APIs in the tooling.\\n\\n## Client libraries\\n\\nWe auto-generate multiple client\\\n    \\ libraries based on our OpenAPI specification. To learn more, visit [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Alaunchdarkly-api+org%3Alaunchdarkly\u0026type=Repositories).\\n\\\n    \\n## Method Overriding\\n\\nSome firewalls and HTTP clients restrict the use of\\\n    \\ verbs other than `GET` and `POST`. In those environments, our API endpoints\\\n    \\ that use `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` verbs will be inaccessible.\\n\\nTo avoid\\\n    \\ this issue, our API supports the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header, allowing clients\\\n    \\ to \\\"tunnel\\\" `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests via a `POST` request.\\n\\n\\\n    For example, if you wish to call one of our `PATCH` resources via a `POST` request,\\\n    \\ you can include `X-HTTP-Method-Override:PATCH` as a header.\\n\\n## Beta resources\\n\\\n    \\nWe sometimes release new API resources in **beta** status before we release\\\n    \\ them with general availability.\\n\\nResources that are in beta are still undergoing\\\n    \\ testing and development. They may change without notice, including becoming\\\n    \\ backwards incompatible.\\n\\nWe try to promote resources into general availability\\\n    \\ as quickly as possible. This happens after sufficient testing and when we're\\\n    \\ satisfied that we no longer need to make backwards-incompatible changes.\\n\\n\\\n    We mark beta resources with a \\\"Beta\\\" callout in our documentation, pictured\\\n    \\ below:\\n\\n\u003e ### This feature is in beta\\n\u003e\\n\u003e To use this feature, pass in a\\\n    \\ header including the `LD-API-Version` key with value set to `beta`. Use this\\\n    \\ header with each call. To learn more, read [Beta resources](/#section/Overview/Beta-resources).\\n\\\n    \\n### Using beta resources\\n\\nTo use a beta resource, you must include a header\\\n    \\ in the request. If you call a beta resource without this header, you'll receive\\\n    \\ a `403` response.\\n\\nUse this header:\\n\\n```\\nLD-API-Version: beta\\n```\\n\\n\\\n    ## Versioning\\n\\nWe try hard to keep our REST API backwards compatible, but we\\\n    \\ occasionally have to make backwards-incompatible changes in the process of shipping\\\n    \\ new features. These breaking changes can cause unexpected behavior if you don't\\\n    \\ prepare for them accordingly.\\n\\nUpdates to our REST API include support for\\\n    \\ the latest features in LaunchDarkly. We also release a new version of our REST\\\n    \\ API every time we make a breaking change. We provide simultaneous support for\\\n    \\ multiple API versions so you can migrate from your current API version to a\\\n    \\ new version at your own pace.\\n\\n### Setting the API version per request\\n\\n\\\n    You can set the API version on a specific request by sending an `LD-API-Version`\\\n    \\ header, as shown in the example below:\\n\\n```\\nLD-API-Version: 20220603\\n```\\n\\\n    \\nThe header value is the version number of the API version you'd like to request.\\\n    \\ The number for each version corresponds to the date the version was released\\\n    \\ in yyyymmdd format. In the example above the version `20220603` corresponds\\\n    \\ to June 03, 2022.\\n\\n### Setting the API version per access token\\n\\nWhen creating\\\n    \\ an access token, you must specify a specific version of the API to use. This\\\n    \\ ensures that integrations using this token cannot be broken by version changes.\\n\\\n    \\nTokens created before versioning was released have their version set to `20160426`\\\n    \\ (the version of the API that existed before versioning) so that they continue\\\n    \\ working the same way they did before versioning.\\n\\nIf you would like to upgrade\\\n    \\ your integration to use a new API version, you can explicitly set the header\\\n    \\ described above.\\n\\n\u003e ### Best practice: Set the header for every client or\\\n    \\ integration\\n\u003e\\n\u003e We recommend that you set the API version header explicitly\\\n    \\ in any client or integration you build.\\n\u003e\\n\u003e Only rely on the access token\\\n    \\ API version during manual testing.\\n\\n### API version changelog\\n\\n|\u003cdiv style=\\\"\\\n    width:75px\\\"\u003eVersion\u003c/div\u003e | Changes |\\n|---|---|\\n| `20220603` | \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eChanged\\\n    \\ the [list projects](tag/Projects#operation/getProjects) return value:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eResponse\\\n    \\ is now paginated with a default limit of `20`.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdded support for filter\\\n    \\ and sort.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe project `environments` field is now expandable.

attributes have a straightforward interpretation. For example,\\\n    \\ to change the name of a feature, [update the feature flag](#operation/patchFeatureFlag)\\\n    \\ with the `name` attribute set to the new name:\\n\\n```json\\n[\\n    { \\\"op\\\":\\\n    \\ \\\"replace\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"New name\\\" }\\n]\\n```\\n\\nThe `variations`\\\n    \\ array represents the different variation values that a feature flag has. For\\\n    \\ a boolean flag, there are two variations: `true` and `false`. Multivariate flags\\\n    \\ have more variation values, and those values could be any JSON type: numbers,\\\n    \\ strings, objects, or arrays. In targeting rules, the variations are referred\\\n    \\ to by their index into this array. Below are some specific examples.\\n\\n## Per-environment\\\n    \\ configurations\\n\\nEach entry in the `environments` map contains a JSON object\\\n    \\ that represents the environment-specific flag configuration data available in\\\n    \\ the flag's Targeting tab. For example, to toggle off a feature flag in your\\\n    \\ production environment, use the following JSON patch operation:\\n\\n```json\\n\\\n    [\\n    { \\\"op\\\": \\\"replace\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/environments/production/on\\\", \\\"value\\\"\\\n    : false }\\n]\\n```\\n\\nTo learn more, read [Targeting users](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flags/targeting-users).\\n\\\n    \\nEach section of the Targeting tab corresponds to a different attribute of the\\\n    \\ per-environment configuration data, as shown here:\\n\\n## Individual user targets\\n\\\n    \\nThe `targets` array in the per-environment configuration data represents the\\\n    \\ individual user targeting rules on the Targeting tab. To learn more, read [Targeting\\\n    \\ users](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flags/targeting-users).\\n\\nEach object\\\n    \\ in the `targets` array represents a list of user keys assigned to a particular\\\n    \\ variation. For example:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    ...\\n    \\\"environments\\\" : {\\n \\\n    \\       \\\"production\\\" : {\\n            ...\\n            \\\"targets\\\": [\\n    \\\n    \\            {\\n                    \\\"values\\\": [\\\"foo@example.com\\\"],\\n     \\\n    \\               \\\"variation: 0\\n                }\\n            ]\\n        }\\n\\\n    \\    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis `targets` array here means that user `foo@example.com`\\\n    \\ receives the first variation listed in the `variations` array. Recall that the\\\n    \\ variations are stored at the top level of the flag JSON in an array, and the\\\n    \\ per-environment configuration rules point to indexes into this array. If this\\\n    \\ is a boolean flag, `foo@example.com` is receiving the `true` variation.\\n\\n\\\n    ## Targeting rules\\n\\nThe `rules` array corresponds to the custom targeting rules\\\n    \\ section of the Targeting tab. This is where you can express complex rules on\\\n    \\ attributes with conditions and operators. For example, a rule like \\\"roll out\\\n    \\ the `true` variation to 80% of users whose email address ends with `gmail.com`\\\n    \\ could be expressed here. To learn more, read [Creating targeting rules](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flags/targeting-users#creating-targeting-rules).\\n\\\n    \\n## The fallthrough rule\\n\\nThe `fallthrough` object is a special rule that contains\\\n    \\ no conditions. It is the rollout strategy that is applied when none of the individual\\\n    \\ or custom targeting rules match.\\n\\n## The off variation\\n\\nThe off variation\\\n    \\ represents the variation to serve if the feature flag is turned off, meaning\\\n    \\ the `on` attribute is `false`. For boolean flags, this is usually `false`. For\\\n    \\ multivariate flags, set the off variation to whatever variation represents the\\\n    \\ control or baseline behavior for your application. If you don't set the off\\\n    \\ variation, LaunchDarkly will serve the fallback value defined in your code.\\n\\\n    \\n## Percentage rollouts\\n\\nThe `weight` attribute defines the percentage rollout\\\n    \\ for each variation. Weights range from 0 (a 0% rollout) to 100000 (a 100% rollout).\\\n    \\ The weights are scaled by a factor of 1000 so that fractions of a percent can\\\n    \\ be represented without using floating-point. For example, a weight of `50000`\\\n    \\ means that 50% of users that don't otherwise match any `targets` will see that\\\n    \\ variation. The sum of weights across all variations should be 100%.\\n\"\n  name: Feature flags\n- description: \"\u003e ### This feature is in beta\\n\u003e\\n\u003e To use this feature, pass in a\\\n    \\ header including the `LD-API-Version` key with value set to `beta`.

By default, each\\\n        \\ feature includes configurations for each environment. You can filter environments\\\n        \\ with the env query parameter. For example, setting `env=production` restricts\\\n        \\ the returned configurations to just your production environment. You can\\\n        \\ also filter feature flags by tag with the tag query parameter.\\n\\nWe support\\\n        \\ the following fields for filters:\\n\\n- `query` is a string that matches\\\n        \\ against the flags' keys and names. It is not case sensitive.\\n- `archived`\\\n        \\ is a boolean to filter the list to archived flags. When this is absent,\\\n        \\ only unarchived flags are returned.\\n- `type` is a string allowing filtering\\\n        \\ to `temporary` or `permanent` flags.\\n- `status` is a string allowing filtering\\\n        \\ to `new`, `inactive`, `active`, or `launched` flags in the specified environment.\\\n        \\ This filter also requires a `filterEnv` field to be set to a valid environment.\\\n        \\ For example: `filter=status:active,filterEnv:production`.\\n- `tags` is a\\\n        \\ + separated list of tags. It filters the list to members who have all of\\\n        \\ the tags in the list.\\n- `hasExperiment` is a boolean with values of true\\\n        \\ or false and returns any flags that have an attached metric.\\n- `hasDataExport`\\\n        \\ is a boolean with values of true or false and returns any flags that are\\\n        \\ exporting data in the specified environment. This includes flags that are\\\n        \\ exporting data from Experimentation. This filter also requires that you\\\n        \\ set a `filterEnv` field to a valid environment key. For example: `filter=hasDataExport:true,filterEnv:production`\\n\\\n        - `evaluated` is an object that contains a key of `after` and a value in Unix\\\n        \\ time in milliseconds. This returns all flags that have been evaluated since\\\n        \\ the time you specify in the environment provided. This filter also requires\\\n        \\ you to set a `filterEnv` field to a valid environment. For example: `filter=evaluated:{\\\"\\\n        after\\\": 1590768455282},filterEnv:production`.\\n- `filterEnv` is a string\\\n        \\ with the key of a valid environment. You can use the filterEnv field for\\\n        \\ filters that are environment-specific. If there are multiple environment-specific\\\n        \\ filters, you should only declare this parameter once. For example: `filter=evaluated:{\\\"\\\n        after\\\": 1590768455282},filterEnv:production,status:active`.\\n\\nAn example\\\n        \\ filter is `query:abc,tags:foo+bar`. This matches flags with the string `abc`\\\n        \\ in their key or name, ignoring case, which also have the tags `foo` and\\\n        \\ `bar`.\\n\\nBy default, this returns all flags. You can page through the list\\\n        \\ with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`,\\\n        \\ and `last` links in the returned `_links` field. These links will not be\\\n        \\ present if the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first`\\\n        \\ and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page.\\n\"\n      operationId: getFeatureFlags\n      parameters:\n      - description: The project key\n        explode: false\n        in: path\n        name: projectKey\n        required: true\n        schema:\n          description: The project key\n          format: string\n          type: string\n        style: simple\n      - description: Filter configurations by environment\n        explode: true\n        in: query\n        name: env\n        required: false\n        schema:\n          description: Filter configurations by environment\n          format: string\n          type: string\n        style: form\n      - description: Filter feature flags by tag\n        explode: true\n        in: query\n        name: tag\n        required: false\n        schema:\n          description: Filter feature flags by tag\n          format: string\n          type: string\n        style: form\n      - description: \"The number of feature flags to return.

The request body must be a valid semantic\\\n        \\ patch, JSON patch, or JSON merge patch.\\n\\n## Using semantic patches on\\\n        \\ a segment\\n\\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch`\\\n        \\ to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic\\\n        \\ patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\\n\\nThe body of a semantic\\\n        \\ patch request for updating segments requires an `environmentKey` in addition\\\n        \\ to `instructions` and an optional `comment`. The body of the request takes\\\n        \\ the following properties:\\n\\n* `comment` (string): (Optional) A description\\\n        \\ of the update.\\n* `environmentKey` (string): (Required) The key of the LaunchDarkly\\\n        \\ environment.\\n* `instructions` (array): (Required) A list of actions the\\\n        \\ update should perform. Each action in the list must be an object with a\\\n        \\ `kind` property that indicates the instruction. If the action requires parameters,\\\n        \\ you must include those parameters as additional fields in the object.\\n\\n\\\n        ### Instructions\\n\\nSemantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions\\\n        \\ for updating segments.\\n\\n#### addIncludedUsers\\n\\nAdds user keys to the\\\n        \\ individual user targets included in the segment. Returns an error if this\\\n        \\ causes the same user key to be both included and excluded.\\n\\n##### Parameters\\n\\\n        \\n- `values`: List of user keys.\\n\\n#### addExcludedUsers\\n\\nAdds user keys\\\n        \\ to the individual user targets excluded from the segment.

To learn more, read [Updates using JSON patches](/reference#updates-using-json-patch).\\n\\\n        \\nFor example, to update the description for a segment, use the following\\\n        \\ request body:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"patch\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"op\\\": \\\"replace\\\"\\\n        ,\\n      \\\"path\\\": \\\"/description\\\",\\n      \\\"value\\\": \\\"new description\\\"\\\n        \\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTo update fields in the segment that are arrays, set\\\n        \\ the `path` to the name of the field and then append `/\u003carray index\u003e`. Using\\\n        \\ `/0` adds the new entry to the beginning of the array.\\n\\nFor example, to\\\n        \\ add a rule to a segment, use the following request body:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n\\\n        \\  \\\"patch\\\":[\\n    {\\n      \\\"op\\\": \\\"add\\\",\\n      \\\"path\\\": \\\"/rules/0\\\"\\\n        ,\\n      \\\"value\\\": {\\n        \\\"clauses\\\": [{ \\\"attribute\\\": \\\"email\\\", \\\"\\\n        op\\\": \\\"endsWith\\\", \\\"values\\\": [\\\".edu\\\"], \\\"negate\\\": false }]\\n      }\\n\\\n        \\    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTo add or remove users from segments, we recommend\\\n        \\ using semantic patch.
