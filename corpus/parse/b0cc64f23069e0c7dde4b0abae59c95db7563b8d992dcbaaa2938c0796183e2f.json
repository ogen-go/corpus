This field needs to pass all below criteria, otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned: * The key must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 5,000 characters. * For text attributes, at most 400 values are allowed. Empty values are not allowed. Each value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 256 characters. * For number attributes, at most 400 values are allowed. For product recommendations, an example of extra user information is traffic_channel, which is how a user arrives at the site. Users can arrive at the site by coming to the site directly, coming through Google search, or in other ways.'\n          type: object\n        attributionToken:\n          description: Highly recommended for user events that are the result of PredictionService.Predict.

API methods such as SearchService.Search, ProductService.GetProduct, ProductService.ListProducts will treat requests using \"default_branch\" to the actual branch id set as default. For example, if `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1` is set as default, setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` is equivalent to setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1`. Using multiple branches can be useful when developers would like to have a staging branch to test and verify for future usage. When it becomes ready, developers switch on the staging branch using this API while keeping using `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` as SearchRequest.branch to route the traffic to this staging branch. CAUTION: If you have live predict/search traffic, switching the default branch could potentially cause outages if the ID space of the new branch is very different from the old one. More specifically: * PredictionService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch}. * SearchService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch} (if branch is not explicitly set). * UserEventService will only join events with products from branch {newBranch}.'\n      operationId: retail.projects.locations.catalogs.setDefaultBranch\n      parameters:\n        - description: Full resource name of the catalog, such as `projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog`.\n          in: path\n          name: catalog\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/GoogleCloudRetailV2SetDefaultBranchRequest'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/GoogleProtobufEmpty'\n          description: Successful response\n      security:\n        - Oauth2:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n          Oauth2c:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n      tags:\n        - catalogs\n  /v2/projects/{projectsId}/locations/{locationsId}/operations:\n    get:\n      description: 'Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request.
