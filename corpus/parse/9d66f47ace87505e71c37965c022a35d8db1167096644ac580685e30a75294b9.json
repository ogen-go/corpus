To sign up for an API key please [go here](https://p.nomics.com/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-api).\n\n    [nomics.com](https://nomics.com) is built entirely with the Nomics API. Everything\n    we've done on [nomics.com](https://nomics.com) you can do with our API. There are\n    no internal API endpoints.\n\n    If you need support, reach out to us at our [forums](https://forums.nomics.com).\n\n    # API Server URL\n\n    The Nomics API runs at `https://api.nomics.com/v1`. All requests should be prefixed\n    by the server URL.\n\n    # Rate Limits\n\n    By default free keys have a rate limit of one request per second (1rps). Commercial keys have their\n    rate limits determined by their plan and/or contract. Rate limits are computed on one second intervals.\n\n    **If you exceed your rate limit during the interval you will receive an HTTP 429 error and your API key\n    will be timed out for a short period of time.**\n\nservers:\n  - url: https://api.nomics.com/v1\n    description: API Server\n\ntags:\n  - name: Candles\n    description: |\n      ### What are OHLCV Candles?\n\n      OHLCV Candles is an abbreviation of \"Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume Candlestick Data\". Each \"Candle\"\n      represents a point in time of an asset's price history.\n\n      For example, take the following pricing data:\n\n      | Month    | High | Open | Close | Low |\n      |----------|------|------|-------|-----|\n      | January  | $70  | $20  | $50   | $15 |\n      | February | $66  | $50  | $45   | $25 |\n      | March    | $80  | $45  | $62   | $30 |\n      | April    | $95  | $62  | $85   | $50 |\n      | May      | $90  | $85  | $70   | $60 |\n\n      A candlestick chart of this data in Google Sheets looks like this:\n\n      ![Candlestick Chart](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api-documentation/candlestick-chart.png)\n\n      The lines extending from the boxes are called \"wicks\" and they represent the high and low for that time\n      period. The top and bottom of the boxes represent the open and close. Different visualizations of candles\n      have different ways of conveying which of the top and bottom of the boxes are the open and close. In this\n      case, with Google Sheets, candles that close higher than they open are solid colors, while candles that\n      close lower than they open are transparent.\n\n      ### How are Candles Built?\n\n      At Nomics, we have three methods of building candles:\n\n      1. Building candles from raw, gapless trade execution data (sometimes called \"tick data\")\n      2. Ingesting candles directly from exchanges, and building intermediate sizes\n      3. Ingesting 24 hour tickers from exchanges, and extrapolating estimated candles\n\n      The first method, trades, is greatly preferred as it yields the most accurate and trustworthy data. The second\n      method, candles, is also very accurate, but without the underlying trade data, it is not as transparent. The\n      third method, tickers, is the lowest quality source and should only be used as an estimate of pricing activity.\n\n      ### Why don't candles show up right away?\n\n      You may notice that candles don't show up immediately after they start. For example, at 12:01am, you may not see\n      a daily, hourly, or even a minute candle for 12:00am yet. This is because several steps need to occur in order to\n      build a candle:\n\n      1. Trades must be executed on an exchange. If there are no trades after 12:00am for a market or currency, there\n      is simply no data to represent.\n      2. Trades must be ingested into Nomics. We ingest data as fast as possible, but due to exchange rate limits and\n      limitations on the speed of data across the internet, there is always a delay between a trade being executed and\n      when it arrives in the Nomics database.\n      3. An Exchange Candle must be built. Once we have the trade in our database, we then aggregate all trades within\n      the candle's time range in order to build and store the candle.\n      4. An Aggregate Candle must be built. After an Exchange Candle is built (which represents a single market on a\n      single exchange) we must build an Aggregated Candle (which represents an asset across all markets and exchanges)\n\n      Every step in this pipeline takes time to compute, which means that it will take a few minutes before\n      a trade is fully represented by all candle types in our data set.\n\n      For more information about update frequencies, see the descriptions of our candle types below.\n\nx-tagGroups:\n  - name: Free Plan API Endpoints\n    tags:\n      - Currencies Ticker\n  - name: Commercial API Endpoints\n    tags:\n      - Global\n      - Currencies\n      - Fiat Exchange Rates\n      - Exchanges\n      - Markets\n      - Candles\n      - Trades\n      - Orders\n      - Predictions\n  - name: Account\n    tags:\n      - Usage\n  - name: Other\n    tags:\n      - Deprecated\n\n\npaths:\n  /currencies/ticker:\n    get:\n      tags:\n        - Currencies Ticker\n      summary: Currencies Ticker\n      operationId: getCurrenciesTicker\n      x-code-samples:\n        $ref: \"./samples/getCurrenciesTicker.json\"\n      description: |\n        Price, volume, market cap, rank, and more for all currencies across 1 hour, 1 day, 7 day, 30 day, 365 day, and\n        year to date intervals.\n        \n        Usage on this endpoint **is counted** towards commercial plan API requests.\n\n        Update Frequency: 30 seconds\n      parameters:\n        - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/currency-ids\"\n        - interval:\n          name: interval\n          in: query\n          description: Comma separated time interval of the ticker(s).

Nomics aggregates all markets where the given\n        currency is the base currency and the quote currency is a fiat currency, BTC, or ETH and returns all values in\n        USD.\n\n        Candles are aggregated across all markets for the base currencies, which necessitates converting to a common\n        quote currency. Nomics converts all markets into USD in order to aggregated candles.\n\n        Candles have the following time range limits based on interval and time:\n\n        * `1d`: Available from inception with no range limit\n        * `1h`: Available from inception.
