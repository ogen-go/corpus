It has been deprecated and will be decommissioned\n    on 8 August 2022. We require you to switch to `v1` as soon as\n    possible.|[Click here](https://developers.voxbone.com/legacy/)|\n\n    |`v1`|Our current API, which includes number ordering, compliance,\n    configuration and inventory management to support your Voice and SMS\n    communications.|[Click here](https://dev.bandwidth.com/apis/global/)|\n\n    |`v2`|Our CDRs (Call Detail Records) API.|[Click\n    here](https://dev.bandwidth.com/apis/global/v2/)|\n\n    |`beta`|Early access to APIs under development including Number Whitelisting\n    and Number Porting.|Currently viewing|\n\n\n    ## Access\n\n\n    Authentication for Bandwidth's global API is done with API keys. Please\n    ensure:\n\n\n    - Your account is activated for API access. You can do so on our [Global\n    Portal](https://app.voxbone.com/home). If you have trouble, reach out to\n    your account manager or raise a support ticket.\n\n    - You've setup an API key. You can generate your API key under **Settings \u003e\n    API**.\n\n\n    ## Environments\n\n\n    There are currently two environments for our global APIs:\n\n\n    | Environment | Base URL | Description |\n\n    | --- | --- | --- |\n\n    | Production | https://api.voxbone.com | Live production network. |\n\n    | Sandbox | https://api.sandbox.voxbone.com | Intended for simulating\n    ordering and address verification. You can test ordering without being\n    charged, service activation and more. Any API calls performed through our\n    Sandbox API can be viewed via our [Sandbox\n    Portal](https://sandbox.voxbone.com/sandbox-v3/). |\n\n\n    ## Security \u0026 Rate Limiting\n\n\n    For protecting both your apps and our systems, a __20 requests per second by\n    client IP__ is performed on your API calls. If you send more requests, your\n    requests may be rejected by an `HTTP 509 Bandwidth Limit Exceeded` or `HTTP\n    429 Too Many Requests` in the response.\n  contact:\n    name: users@cxf.apache.org\n  version: '1'\nservers:\n  - url: https://api.voxbone.com/beta\ntags:\n  - name: Number Porting\n    description: \u003e\n      Bandwidth understands that number porting is a powerful tool that enables\n      you to bring all your existing voice services under one umbrella. \n\n\n      By bringing your existing phone numbers to Bandwidth, you can keep the\n      numbers you have and mitigate the disruption that comes from changing\n      number.\n\n\n      We already take care of this for you but with our new Number Porting API\n      we hope to make this process as smooth as possible! With our API you will\n      be able to check number portability, submit port requests and view the\n      status of an existing request.\n\n\n      #####Limitations:\n\n      Currently, Tollfree numbers from Germany and India are not supported for\n      porting via API; please contact the Bandwidth LNP team for handling these\n      requests.\n  - name: Number Whitelisting\n    description: \u003e\n      Number Whitelisting let's you take advantage of Bandwidth's network, but\n      without necessarily buying Bandwidth numbers.\npaths:\n  /porting-api/eligibility/{number}:\n    get:\n      tags:\n        - Number Porting\n      summary: Check number portability\n      description: Allows you to check number portability.\n      operationId: checkNumberEligibilityUsingGET\n      parameters:\n        - name: number\n          in: path\n          description: Single number in E164 format.\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n          example: '3228080000'\n        - name: ownership\n          in: query\n          description: Ownership type of the current number.\n          schema:\n            type: string\n            enum:\n              - BUSINESS\n              - PERSONAL\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: OK\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \u003e-\n                  #/components/schemas/PortingResponse«NumberAdditionalInformationVO»\n        '400':\n          description: Bad Request\n          content: {}\n        '401':\n          description: Unauthorized\n          content: {}\n        '403':\n          description: Forbidden\n          content: {}\n        '404':\n          description: Not Found\n          content: {}\n      security:\n        - apiKey: []\n    x-summary: Check number portability\n    x-description: \u003e\n      Check if a single number is portable to Bandwidth.
