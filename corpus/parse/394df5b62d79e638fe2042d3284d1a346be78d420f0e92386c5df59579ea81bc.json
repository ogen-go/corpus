For more information about using this service, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/introduction.html\">Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>API Version</b> </p> <p>This version of the Secrets Manager API Reference documents the Secrets Manager API version 2017-10-17.</p> <note> <p>As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms such as Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, and Android. The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. For example, the SDKs provide cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including downloading and installing them, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p> </note> <p>We recommend you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make programmatic API calls to Secrets Manager. However, you also can use the Secrets Manager HTTP Query API to make direct calls to the Secrets Manager web service. To learn more about the Secrets Manager HTTP Query API, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/query-requests.html\">Making Query Requests</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide</i>. </p> <p>Secrets Manager API supports GET and POST requests for all actions, and doesn''t require you to use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that require larger sizes, use a POST request.</p> <p> <b>Support and Feedback for Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager</b> </p> <p>We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to <a href=\"mailto:awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com\">awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com</a>, or post your feedback and questions in the <a href=\"http://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=296\">Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Discussion Forum</a>. For more information about the Amazon Web Services Discussion Forums, see <a href=\"http://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa\">Forums Help</a>.</p> <p> <b>How examples are presented</b> </p> <p>The JSON that Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager expects as your request parameters and the service returns as a response to HTTP query requests contain single, long strings without line breaks or white space formatting. The JSON shown in the examples displays the code formatted with both line breaks and white space to improve readability. When example input parameters can also cause long strings extending beyond the screen, you can insert line breaks to enhance readability. You should always submit the input as a single JSON text string.</p> <p> <b>Logging API Requests</b> </p> <p>Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager supports Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information that''s collected by Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, you can determine the requests successfully made to Secrets Manager, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager and support for Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring.html#monitoring_cloudtrail\">Logging Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Events with Amazon Web Services CloudTrail</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide</i>.

A secret in Secrets Manager consists of both the protected secret data and the important information needed to manage the secret.</p> <p>Secrets Manager stores the encrypted secret data in one of a collection of \"versions\" associated with the secret. Each version contains a copy of the encrypted secret data. Each version is associated with one or more \"staging labels\" that identify where the version is in the rotation cycle. The <code>SecretVersionsToStages</code> field of the secret contains the mapping of staging labels to the active versions of the secret. Versions without a staging label are considered deprecated and not included in the list.</p> <p>You provide the secret data to be encrypted by putting text in either the <code>SecretString</code> parameter or binary data in the <code>SecretBinary</code> parameter, but not both. If you include <code>SecretString</code> or <code>SecretBinary</code> then Secrets Manager also creates an initial secret version and automatically attaches the staging label <code>AWSCURRENT</code> to the new version.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p>If you call an operation to encrypt or decrypt the <code>SecretString</code> or <code>SecretBinary</code> for a secret in the same account as the calling user and that secret doesn''t specify a Amazon Web Services KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the account''s default Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) with the alias <code>aws/secretsmanager</code>. If this key doesn''t already exist in your account then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the same Amazon Web Services account automatically have access to use the default CMK.

Store the ARN of the CMK in the secret when you create the secret or when you update it by including it in the <code>KMSKeyId</code>.

After testing the new credentials, the function marks the new secret with the staging label <code>AWSCURRENT</code> so that your clients all immediately begin to use the new version. For more information about rotating secrets and how to configure a Lambda function to rotate the secrets for your protected service, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotating-secrets.html\">Rotating Secrets in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Secrets Manager schedules the next rotation when the previous one completes. Secrets Manager schedules the date by adding the rotation interval (number of days) to the actual date of the last rotation. The service chooses the hour within that 24-hour date window randomly. The minute is also chosen somewhat randomly, but weighted towards the top of the hour and influenced by a variety of factors that help distribute load.</p> <p>The rotation function must end with the versions of the secret in one of two states:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The <code>AWSPENDING</code> and <code>AWSCURRENT</code> staging labels are attached to the same version of the secret, or</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>AWSPENDING</code> staging label is not attached to any version of the secret.</p> </li> </ul> <p>If the <code>AWSPENDING</code> staging label is present but not attached to the same version as <code>AWSCURRENT</code> then any later invocation of <code>RotateSecret</code> assumes that a previous rotation request is still in progress and returns an error.</p> <p> <b>Minimum permissions</b> </p> <p>To run this command, you must have the following permissions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>secretsmanager:RotateSecret</p> </li> <li> <p>lambda:InvokeFunction (on the function specified in the secret''s metadata)</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Related operations</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>To list the secrets in your account, use <a>ListSecrets</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>To get the details for a version of a secret, use <a>DescribeSecret</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>To create a new version of a secret, use <a>CreateSecret</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>To attach staging labels to or remove staging labels from a version of a secret, use <a>UpdateSecretVersionStage</a>.</p> </li> </ul>'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Success\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/RotateSecretResponse'\n        '480':\n          description: ResourceNotFoundException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ResourceNotFoundException'\n        '481':\n          description: InvalidParameterException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/InvalidParameterException'\n        '482':\n          description: InternalServiceError\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/InternalServiceError'\n        '483':\n          description: InvalidRequestException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/InvalidRequestException'\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/RotateSecretRequest'\n      parameters:\n        -

For more information about staging labels, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/terms-concepts.html#term_staging-label\">Staging Labels</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide</i>. </p> <p>The staging labels that you specify in the <code>VersionStage</code> parameter are added to the existing list of staging labels--they don''t replace it.</p> <p>You can move the <code>AWSCURRENT</code> staging label to this version by including it in this call.</p> <note> <p>Whenever you move <code>AWSCURRENT</code>, Secrets Manager automatically moves the label <code>AWSPREVIOUS</code> to the version that <code>AWSCURRENT</code> was removed from.</p> </note> <p>If this action results in the last label being removed from a version, then the version is considered to be ''deprecated'' and can be deleted by Secrets Manager.</p> <p> <b>Minimum permissions</b> </p> <p>To run this command, you must have the following permissions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>secretsmanager:UpdateSecretVersionStage</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Related operations</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>To get the list of staging labels that are currently associated with a version of a secret, use <code> <a>DescribeSecret</a> </code> and examine the <code>SecretVersionsToStages</code> response value. </p> </li> </ul>'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Success\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/UpdateSecretVersionStageResponse'\n        '480':\n          description: ResourceNotFoundException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ResourceNotFoundException'\n        '481':\n          description: InvalidParameterException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/InvalidParameterException'\n        '482':\n          description: InvalidRequestException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/InvalidRequestException'\n        '483':\n          description: LimitExceededException\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/LimitExceededException'\n        '484':\n          description: InternalServiceError\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/InternalServiceError'\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/UpdateSecretVersionStageRequest'\n      parameters:\n        - name: X-Amz-Target\n          in: header\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n            enum:\n              - secretsmanager.UpdateSecretVersionStage\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Content-Sha256'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Date'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Algorithm'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Credential'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Security-Token'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-Signature'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Amz-SignedHeaders'\n  /#X-Amz-Target=secretsmanager.ValidateResourcePolicy:\n    post:\n      operationId: ValidateResourcePolicy\n      description: '<p>Validates that the resource policy does not grant a wide range of IAM principals access to your secret.
