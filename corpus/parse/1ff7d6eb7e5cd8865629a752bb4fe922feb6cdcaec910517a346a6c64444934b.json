If the task's queue was created using\n            queue.yaml or\n\n            queue.xml, then another task with the same name can't be created\n\n            for ~9days after the original task was deleted or executed.\n\n\n            Because there is an extra lookup cost to identify duplicate task\n\n            names, these CreateTask calls have significantly\n\n            increased latency. Using hashed strings for the task id or for\n\n            the prefix of the task id is recommended. Choosing task ids that\n\n            are sequential or have sequential prefixes, for example using a\n\n            timestamp, causes an increase in latency and error rates in all\n\n            task commands.
