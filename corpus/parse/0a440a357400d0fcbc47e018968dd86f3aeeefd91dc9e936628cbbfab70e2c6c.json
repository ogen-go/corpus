Develop and run the data job locally.\n    <li> Deploy the data job in cloud runtime environment to run on a scheduled basis.\n    <br><br>\n    If Authentication is enabled, pass OAuth2 access token in HTTP header 'Authorization: Bearer [access-token-here]' (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750).\n    <br\n\n    The API promotes some best practices (inspired by https://12factor.net):\n    <li> Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.\n    <li> Strict separation of configurations from code. Configurations vary substantially across deploys, code does not.\n    <li> Separation between the build, release/deploy, and run stages.\n    <li> Data Jobs are stateless and share-nothing processes. Any data that needs to be persisted must be stored in a stateful backing service (e.g IProperties).\n    <li> Implementation is assumed to be atomic and idempotent - should be OK for a job to fail somewhere in the middle; subsequent restart should not cause data corruption.\n    <li> Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible.\n    <br><br>\n    <b>API Evolution</b><br>\n    In the following sections, there are some terms that have a special meaning in the context of the APIs.\n    <br><br>\n    <li> <i>Stable</i> - The implementation of the API has been battle-tested (has been in production for some time).\n                         The API is a subject to semantic versioning model and will follow deprecation policy.\n    <li> <i>Experimental</i> - May disappear without notice and is not a subject to semantic versioning.\n                               Implementation of the API is not considered stable nor well tested.\n                               Generally this is given to clients to experiment within testing environment. Must not be used in production.\n    <li> <i>Deprecated</i> - API is expected to be removed within next one or two major version upgrade.\n                             The deprecation notice/comment will say when the API will be removed and what alternatives should be used instead.\n\npaths:\n\n  '/data-jobs/for-team/{team_name}/info':\n    get:\n      tags:\n        - Data Jobs Service\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/Info'\n      operationId: info\n      summary: Get API and Data Jobs Service info\n      description: <i>(Introduced in v1.0)</i> | Get API and Data Jobs service information\n      parameters:\n        -  name: team_name\n           description: Team Name\n           schema:\n             type: string\n           in: path\n           required: true\n\n  '/data-jobs/for-team/{team_name}':\n    get:\n      deprecated: true\n      tags:\n        - Data Jobs\n      parameters:\n        - name: team_name\n          description: Team Name\n          schema:\n            type: string\n          in: path\n          required: true\n        - name: show_all\n          description: |\n            If set to 'true' will list the jobs for all the teams, otherwise will list only the jobs that belong to this team.\n          schema:\n            type: boolean\n            default: False\n          in: query\n          # This API supports pagination, because there can be thousands of data jobs.\n          # Page parameters are based on the offset and limit example at\n          # https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-parameters/#default adjusted for easier Spring use.\n          # We intentionally don't support consistent paging via cursors because it is quite resource-intensive -\n          # until explicitly requested.\n        - name: page_number\n          description: The number of pages of items to skip before starting to collect the result set.\n          schema:\n            type: integer\n            minimum: 0\n            default: 0\n            example: 0\n          required: false\n          in: query\n        - name: page_size\n          schema:\n            type: integer\n            minimum: 1\n            maximum: 100 # Over 100 items will make the resulting JSON too large to serialize safely.\n            default: 20\n            example: 0\n          required: false\n          description: The number of items per page\n          in: query\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                type: array\n                items:\n                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/DataJobSummary'\n          description: List of jobs\n        '400':\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/Error'\n      operationId: jobsList\n      summary: List all or Team's Data Jobs | (Stable)\n      description: <i>(Introduced in v1.0)</i>\n\n  '/data-jobs/for-team/{team_name}/jobs':\n    get:\n      operationId: jobsQuery\n      summary: List Data Jobs  | (Experimental)\n      tags:\n        - Data Jobs\n      description: |\n        List data Jobs with GraphQL like query. By choosing which field to be returned you can control the output.\n        You can learn more about the GraphQL queries by visiting [GraphQL official website](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/)\n        Query should be provided as GET parameter, not by POST body. Don't worry about the spaces and tabs\n        Keep in mind that each aditional field <b>could make query response time slower, for instance deployments</b>,\n        it's best if you request only what you need <br/><br/>\n\n        The <b>pageNumber</b> and <b>pageSize</b> arguments are required! Page number should be a <b>number greater than 1</b>,\n        and pageSize <b>should be greater than 1</b> (per page)\n        Check the latest example for the full list of supported query fields.<br/><br/>\n\n        Simplest query that you could make is to fetch the job names\n        <pre>\n        {<br/>\n          jobs(pageNumber: 1, pageSize: 25) {<br/>\n            content {<br/>\n              jobName<br/>\n            }<br/>\n          }<br/>\n        }<br/>\n        </pre><br/>\n\n        You could also use filtering and sorting function. Filter object has <b>property, pattern and sort</b> fields.<br/>\n        * <b>property</b> points out which field you want to filter, if you point out some other field that is not supported,\n        an invalid response will be return.<br/>\n        * <b>pattern</b> should be a non-empty string which the provided property should contains [ignoring cases], for instance: `starshot` pattern will match\n        <b>import-starshot-sql, StarShot-servers and notify-starshot</b> job names, but it won't match <b>stars-shot-daily-prune`</b>\n        If a pattern string is not provided, then you must atleast provide the property field<br/>\n        * <b>sort</b> should be an enum value - ASC (ascending) or DESC (descending) option [not required, default is ASC]\n        Multiple filters could be applied, but <b>maximum one should contain sorting</b>!\n        <pre>\n        {<br/>\n          jobs(<br/>\n            pageNumber: 1,<br/>\n            pageSize: 25,<br/>\n            filter: [{<br/>\n              property: \"jobName\",<br/>\n              pattern: \"starshot\",<br/>\n              sort: \"DESC\"<br/>\n            }],<br/>\n          ) {<br/>\n            content {<br/>\n              jobName<br/>\n            }<br/>\n          }<br/>\n        }<br/>\n        </pre><br/>\n\n        You could also search for a string into the properties that you are requesting, for instance:\n        This query will search for job names, team names and descriptions which contains the provided \"starshot\" string\n        <pre>\n        {<br/>\n          jobs(<br/>\n            pageNumber: 1,<br/>\n            pageSize: 25,<br/>\n            search: \"starshot\"<br/>\n          ) {<br/>\n            content {<br/>\n              jobName,<br/>\n              config {<br/>\n                team<br/>\n                description<br/>\n              }<br/>\n            }<br/>\n          }<br/>\n        }<br/>\n        </pre><br/>\n\n        Data jobs execution could also be searched by providing arguments to the <b>execution</b> field.\n        Same as parent query arguments, the <b>pageNumber</b> and <b>pageSize</b> arguments are required! Page number should be a <b>number greater than 1</b>,\n        and pageSize <b>should be between 1 and 100 results</b> (per page). You can also <b>filter</b> using the similar object structure as the parent query,\n        but currently <b>filtering is not supported</b>, you can only provide field for sorting.\n        This query will search\n        <pre>\n        {<br/>\n          jobs(<br/>\n            pageNumber: 1,<br/>\n            pageSize: 25,<br/>\n          ) {<br/>\n            content {<br/>\n              jobName,<br/>\n              deployments {<br/>\n                id<br/>\n                executions(<br/>\n                  pageNumber: 1,<br/>\n                  pageSize: 5<br/>\n                  filter: [{<br/>\n                    property: \"deployments.executions.startTime\",<br/>\n                    sort: \"DESC\",<br/>\n                  }],<br/>\n                ) {<br/>\n                  id\n                  status\n                  startTime\n                  endTime\n                {</br>\n              }<br/>\n            }<br/>\n          }<br/>\n        }<br/>\n        </pre><br/>\n\n        Full example of currently available for fetching fields. Note that if you combine searching and filtering, first\n        it will apply filters and then within filtered jobs it will apply the search, vice versa is currently not supported:\n        <pre>\n        {<br/>\n          jobs(<br/>\n            pageNumber: 1,<br/>\n            pageSize: 25,<br/>\n            search: \"daily\",<br/>\n            filter: [{<br/>\n              property: \"jobName\",<br/>\n              pattern: \"import-sql\",<br/>\n            },{<br/>\n              property: \"team\",<br/>\n              pattern: \"starshot\",<br/>\n              sort: \"DESC\" <br/>\n            },{<br/>\n              property: \"deployments.enabled\",<br/>\n              pattern: \"enabled\",<br/>\n            }],<br/>\n          ) {<br/>\n            content {<br/>\n              jobName<br/>\n              config {<br/>\n                team<br/>\n                description<br/>\n                sourceUrl<br/>\n                schedule {<br/>\n                  scheduleCron<br/>\n                  nextRunEpochSeconds<br/>\n                }<br/>\n                contacts {<br/>\n                  notifiedOnJobFailureUserError<br/>\n                  notifiedOnJobFailurePlatformError<br/>\n                  notifiedOnJobSuccess<br/>\n                  notifiedOnJobDeploy<br/>\n                }<br/>\n              }<br/>\n              deployments {<br/>\n                id<br/>\n                enabled<br/>\n                jobVersion<br/>\n                mode<br/>\n                executions(<br/>\n                  pageNumber: 1,<br/>\n                  pageSize: 25<br/>\n                  filter: [{<br/>\n                    property: \"deployments.executions.status\",<br/>\n                    sort: \"ASC\",<br/>\n                  }],<br/>\n                ) {<br/>\n                  id<br/>\n                  type<br/>\n                  status<br/>\n                  message<br/>\n                  startTime<br/>\n                  endTime<br/>\n                  opId<br/>\n                  vkdVersion<br/>\n                  jobVersion<br/>\n                  jobSchedule<br/>\n                  resourcesCpuRequest<br/>\n                  resourcesCpuLimit</br>\n                  resourcesMemoryRequest</br>\n                  resourcesMemoryLimit</br>\n                  deployedDate</br>\n                  deployedBy</br>\n                  startedBy</br>\n                  logsUrl</br>\n                }<br/>\n              }<br/>\n            }<br/>\n            totalPages<br/>\n            totalItems<br/>\n            }<br/>\n          }<br/>\n        }<br/>\n        </pre><br/>\n\n      parameters:\n        -
