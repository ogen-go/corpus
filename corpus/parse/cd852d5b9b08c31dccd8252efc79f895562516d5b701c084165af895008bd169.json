Where a region is supplied annotation of all alleles vs all features in the region is returned. Where a set of features is supplied, only annotations against these features (matching on featuretype and id) are returned and other overlapping features are ignored.\n\n        `variantannotationsets/search` returns information on the input to the annotation. This will be a VariantSet and the reference data and software versions used in calculating the annotation. It is essential this information is exhaustive.\n\n        `POST /variantannotations/search` must accept a JSON version of `SearchVariantAnnotationsRequest` as the post body and will return a JSON version of `SearchVariantAnnotationsResponse`.\n      operationId: SearchVariantAnnotations\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: A successful response.\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/SearchVariantAnnotationsResponse'\n      tags:\n        - GA4GH\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/SearchVariantAnnotationsRequest'\n        required: true"
