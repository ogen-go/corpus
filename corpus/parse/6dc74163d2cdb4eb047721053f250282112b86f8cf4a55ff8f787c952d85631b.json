To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API\\\n    \\ key as the value, for example:\\n\\n ```\\ncurl\\n-H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\"\\\n    \\ \\\\\\n-H \\\"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\\\" \\\\\\n...\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively, you can use\\\n    \\ the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication.\\\n    \\ For example:\\n\\n```\\ncurl\\n-H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\" \\\\\\n-U \\\"ws@BalancePlatform.YOUR_BALANCE_PLATFORM\\\"\\\n    :\\\"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD\\\" \\\\\\n...\\n```\\n## Versioning\\nThe Balance Platform Configuration\\\n    \\ API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning)\\\n    \\ using a version suffix in the endpoint URL.
