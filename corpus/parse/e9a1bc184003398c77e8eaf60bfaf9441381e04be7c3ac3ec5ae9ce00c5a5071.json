To sort you can sort on the elements that are specified per endpoint. All elements can be sorted ascending by default or descending,\n      by adding \"-\" in front of the element to be sorted. The sorting takes place based on comma separated values. e.g.:\n\n      ```\n      GET /programs?sort=programId\n      ```\n      provides a list of all programs sorted ascending based on programId\n      ```\n      GET /programs?sort=name,-ects\n      ```\n      provides a list of all programs first sorted on name ascending and ects descending\n\n  - name: extension information\n    description: |\n      Most endpoints can be extended.

For OOAPI we choose to use a subset of the [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/). More information and guidelines can be read [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)\n      The description SHOULD NOT use: Task list Items, The images element and Raw HTML for optimal interoperability. Git Hub Markdown is choosen as it provides some extra structure for data input on top of commonmark Markdown.
