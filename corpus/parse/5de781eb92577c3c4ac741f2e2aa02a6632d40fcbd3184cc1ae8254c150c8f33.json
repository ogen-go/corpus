The grouping should be based on usage, e.g.,\n        personal data used for marketing, personal data collected for usage\n        analysis, or personal data processed for technical realisation of the\n        service. The same personal data type (e.g., an email address) may be in\n        several contexts; this does not imply it would be actually duplicated in\n        the system, but it could be used in different contexts. Typically, a\n        single context should not contain data that is processed under different\n        basis of processing.\n      parameters:\n        - name: Accept-Language\n          description: A list of accepted languages.\n          in: header\n          schema:\n            type: string\n          required: false\n          example: fi_FI\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: OK\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ContextsResponse'\n        '400':\n          description: Invalid Request\n        '404':\n          description: No UUID found\n  '/exportrequests/{context_uuid}':\n    post:\n      tags:\n        - export\n      summary: Export personal data\n      description: \u003e-\n        Create an export request to export all personal data stored within a\n        particular personal data context.
