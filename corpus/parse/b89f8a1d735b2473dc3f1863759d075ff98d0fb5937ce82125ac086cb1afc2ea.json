Celo Blockchain enables access to most commonly used Celo methods.\n      These methods bring small level of abstraction,\n             and are used for the type of applications that want to communicate with blockchain directly. Some of the methods are used alongside Tatum Private Ledger\n             to connect blockchain and private ledger together, like wallet generation or getting information about transactions.\u003cbr/\u003e\n            Tatum supports 2 chains:\n            \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMainnet - regular live chain\n            \u003cli\u003eAlfajorec - test chain used for testing purposes.
