[Bulk downloads](https://www.fec.gov/data/advanced/?tab=bulk-data) are available on the current site. Information is tied to the underlying forms by file ID and image ID. Data is updated nightly. \n\n     There is a lot of data, but a good place to start is to use search to find interesting candidates and committees. Then, you can use their IDs to find report or line item details with the other endpoints. If you are interested in individual donors, check out contributor information in schedule_a. \n\n     Get an [API key here](https://api.data.gov/signup/). That will enable you to place up to 1,000 calls an hour. Each call is limited to 100 results per page. You can email questions, comments or a request to get a key for 120 calls per minute to [APIinfo@fec.gov](mailto:apiinfo@fec.gov). You can also ask questions and discuss the data in the [FEC data Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fec-data). API changes will also be added to this group in advance of the change. \n\n     \n\n     The model definitions and schema are available at [/swagger](/swagger/). This is useful for making wrappers and exploring the data. \n\n     A few restrictions limit the way you can use FEC data. For example, you can’t use contributor lists for commercial purposes or to solicit donations.

This information is organized by candidate_id. If\n      you're unfamiliar with candidate IDs, using `/candidates/search` will help\n      you locate a particular candidate. \n\n       Officially, a candidate is an individual seeking nomination for election to a federal office. People become candidates when they (or agents working on their behalf) raise contributions or make expenditures that exceed $5,000. \n\n       The candidate endpoints primarily use data from FEC registration [Form 1](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm1.pdf), for candidate information, and [Form 2](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm2.pdf), for committee information.\n    name: candidate\n  - description: \u003e-\n      Committees are entities that spend and raise money in an election. Their\n      characteristics and relationships with candidates can change over time. \n\n       You might want to use filters or search endpoints to find the committee you're looking for. Then you can use other committee endpoints to explore information about the committee that interests you. \n\n       Financial information is organized by `committee_id`, so finding the committee you're interested in will lead you to more granular financial information. \n\n       The committee endpoints include all FEC filers, even if they aren't registered as a committee. \n\n       Officially, committees include the committees and organizations that file with the FEC. Several different types of organizations file financial reports with the FEC: \n\n       *Campaign committees authorized by particular candidates to raise and spend funds in their campaigns. Non-party committees (e.g., PACs), some of which may be sponsored by corporations, unions, trade or membership groups, etc. Political party committees at the national, state, and local levels. Groups and individuals making only independent expenditures Corporations, unions, and other organizations making internal communications* \n\n       The committee endpoints primarily use data from FEC registration Form 1 and Form 2.\n    name: committee\n  - description: Reporting deadlines, election dates FEC meetings, events etc.\n    name: dates\n  - description: \u003e-\n      Fetch key information about a committee's Form 3, Form 3X, or Form 3P\n      financial reports. \n\n       Most committees are required to summarize their financial activity in each filing; those summaries are included in these files. Generally, committees file reports on a quarterly or monthly basis, but some must also submit a report 12 days before primary elections. Therefore, during the primary season, the period covered by this file may be different for different committees. These totals also incorporate any changes made by committees, if any report covering the period is amended. \n\n       Information is made available on the API as soon as it's processed. Keep in mind, complex paper filings take longer to process. \n\n       The financial endpoints use data from FEC [form 5](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm5.pdf), for independent expenditors; or the summary and detailed summary pages of the FEC [Form 3](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3.pdf), for House and Senate committees; [Form 3X](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3x.pdf), for PACs and parties; and [Form 3P](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3p.pdf), for presidential committees.\n    name: financial\n  - description: Search for candidates, committees by name.\n    name: search\n  - description: \u003e-\n      All official records and reports filed by or delivered to the FEC. \n\n       Note: because the filings data includes many records, counts for large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.\n    name: filings\n  - description: \u003e-\n      Schedule A records describe itemized receipts reported by a committee.\n      This is where you can look for individual contributors. If you are\n      interested in individual donors, `/schedules/schedule_a` will be the\n      endpoint you use. \n\n       Once a person gives more than a total of $200, the donations of that person must be reported by committees that file F3, F3X and F3P forms. \n\n       Contributions $200 and under are not required to be itemized, but you can find the total amount of these small donations by looking up the \"unitemized\" field in the `/reports` or `/totals` endpoints. \n\n       When comparing the totals from reports to line items. the totals will not match unless you only look at items where `\"is_individual\":true` since the same transaction is in the data multiple ways to explain the way it may move though different committees as an earmark. See the `is_individual` sql function within the migrations for more details. \n\n       For the Schedule A aggregates, such as by_occupation and by_state, include only unique individual contributions. See below for full methodology. \n\n       __Methodology for determining unique, individual contributions__ \n\n       For receipts over $200 use FEC code line_number to identify individuals. \n\n       The line numbers that specify individuals that are automatically included: \n\n       Line number with description - 10 Contribution to Independent Expenditure-Only Committees (Super PACs), Political Committees with non-contribution accounts (Hybrid PACs) and nonfederal party \"soft money\" accounts (1991-2002) from a person (individual, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, labor organization, or any other organization or group of persons) - 15 Contribution to political committees (other than Super PACs and Hybrid PACs) from an individual, partnership or limited liability company - 15E Earmarked contributions to political committees (other than Super PACs and Hybrid PACs) from an individual, partnership or limited liability company - 15J Memo - Recipient committee's percentage of contribution from an individual, partnership or limited liability company given to joint fundraising committee - 18J | Memo - Recipient committee's percentage of contribution from a registered committee given to joint fundraising committee - 30, 30T, 31, 31T, 32 Individual party codes \n\n       For receipts under $200: We check the following codes and see if there is \"earmark\" (or a variation) in the `memo_text` description of the contribution. \n\n       Line number with description -11AI The itemized individual contributions from F3 schedule A -12 Nonfederal other receipt - Levin Account (Line 2) -17 Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P -17A Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P -18 Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P \n\n       Of those transactions,[under $200, and having \"earmark\" in the memo text OR transactions having the codes 11A, 12, 17, 17A, or 18], we then want to exclude earmarks.\n    name: receipts\n  - description: Schedule B filings describe itemized disbursements.

These figures are reported\n      as part of forms F3, F3X and F3P.\n    name: disbursements\n  - description: Schedule C shows all loans, endorsements and loan guarantees a committee\n      receives or makes.\n    name: loans\n  - description: Schedule D, it shows debts and obligations owed to or by the committee\n      that are required to be disclosed.\n    name: debts\n  - description: \u003e-\n      Schedule E covers the line item expenditures for independent expenditures.\n      For example, if a super PAC bought ads on TV to oppose a federal\n      candidate, each ad purchase would be recorded here with the expenditure\n      amount, name and id of the candidate, and whether the ad supported or\n      opposed the candidate. \n\n       An independent expenditure is an expenditure for a communication \"expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate that is not made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate’s authorized committee, or their agents, or a political party or its agents.\" \n\n       Aggregates by candidate do not include 24 and 48 hour reports. This ensures we don't double count expenditures and the totals are more accurate. You can still find the information from 24 and 48 hour reports in `/schedule/schedule_e/`.\n    name: independent expenditures\n  - description: Schedule F, it shows all special expenditures a national or state party\n      committee makes in connection with the general election campaigns of\n      federal candidates.\n    name: party-coordinated expenditures\n  - description: Reports of communication costs by corporations and membership\n      organizations from the FEC [F7\n      forms](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecform7.pdf).\n    name: communication cost\n  - description: \u003e-\n      An electioneering communication is any broadcast, cable or satellite\n      communication that fulfills each of the following conditions: \n\n       _The communication refers to a clearly identified federal candidate._ \n\n       _The communication is publicly distributed by a television station, radio station, cable television system or satellite system for a fee._ \n\n       _The communication is distributed within 60 days prior to a general election or 30 days prior to a primary election to federal office._\n    name: electioneering\n  - description: |-\n      Useful tools for those who file with the FEC. \n\n       Look up RAD analyst with telephone extension by committee_id.\n    name: filer resources\n  - description: \u003e-\n      Efiling endpoints provide real-time campaign finance data for electronic\n      filers. \n\n       These endpoints are perfect for watching filings roll in when you want to know the latest information. Efiling endpoints only contain the most recent two years worth of data and don't contain the processed and coded data that you can find on the other endpoints. Those endpoints are better for in-depth analysis. \n\n       Senate candidates and committees are required to file by paper. Other committees who raise and spend less than $50,000 in a calendar can choose whether to file electronically or by paper. \n\n       DISCLAIMER: The field labels contained within this resource are subject to change.

See below for full methodology.\n\n\n        __Methodology for determining unique, individual contributions__\n\n\n        For receipts over $200 use FEC code line_number to identify individuals.\n\n\n        The line numbers that specify individuals that are automatically included:\n\n\n        Line number with description\n            - 10 Contribution to Independent Expenditure-Only Committees (Super PACs),\n                 Political Committees with non-contribution accounts (Hybrid PACs)\n                 and nonfederal party \"soft money\" accounts (1991-2002)\n                 from a person (individual, partnership, limited liability company,\n                 corporation, labor organization, or any other organization or\n                 group of persons)\n            - 15 Contribution to political committees (other than Super PACs\n                 and Hybrid PACs) from an individual, partnership or\n                 limited liability company\n            - 15E Earmarked contributions to political committees\n                  (other than Super PACs and Hybrid PACs) from an individual,\n                  partnership or limited liability company\n            - 15J Memo - Recipient committee's percentage of contribution\n                  from an individual, partnership or limited liability\n                  company given to joint fundraising committee\n            - 18J | Memo - Recipient committee's percentage of contribution\n                  from a registered committee given to joint fundraising committee\n            - 30, 30T, 31, 31T, 32 Individual party codes\n\n        For receipts under $200:\n\n        We check the following codes and see if there is \"earmark\" (or a variation) in the `memo_text`\n\n        description of the contribution.\n\n\n        Line number with description\n            -11AI The itemized individual contributions from F3 schedule A\n            -12 Nonfederal other receipt - Levin Account (Line 2)\n            -17 Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P\n            -17A Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P\n            -18 Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P\n\n        Of those transactions,[under $200, and having \"earmark\" in the memo text OR transactions having the codes 11A, 12, 17, 17A, or 18], we then want to exclude earmarks.\n\n\n\n        All receipt data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which\n\n        is derived from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form. If no value is supplied, the results\n\n        will default to the most recent two-year period that is named after the ending,\n\n        even-numbered year.\n\n\n        Due to the large quantity of Schedule A filings, this endpoint is not paginated by\n\n        page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in\n\n        the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For\n\n        example, when sorting by `contribution_receipt_date`, you might receive a page of\n\n        results with the following pagination information:\n\n\n        ```\n\n        pagination: {\n            pages: 2152643,\n            per_page: 20,\n            count: 43052850,\n            last_indexes: {\n                last_index: \"230880619\",\n                last_contribution_receipt_date: \"2014-01-01\"\n            }\n        }\n\n        ```\n\n\n        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230880619` and\n\n        `last_contribution_receipt_date=2014-01-01` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through\n\n        these results by using sort indices (defaults to sort by contribution date), otherwise some resources may be\n\n        unintentionally filtered out.  This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance and these indices\n\n        are required to properly page through this large dataset.\n\n\n        Note: because the Schedule A data includes many records, counts for\n\n        large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.\n      parameters:\n        - description: The image number of the page where the schedule item is reported\n          in: query\n          name: image_number\n          required: false\n          explode: true\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              type: string\n        - description: Restrict to non-earmarked individual contributions where memo code\n            is true.

If you are interested in\n\n        individual donors, `/schedules/schedule_a` will be the endpoint you use.\n\n\n        Once a person gives more than a total of $200, the donations of that person must be\n\n        reported by committees that file F3, F3X and F3P forms.\n\n\n        Contributions $200 and under are not required to be itemized, but you can find the total\n\n        amount of these small donations by looking up the \"unitemized\" field in the `/reports`\n\n        or `/totals` endpoints.\n\n\n        When comparing the totals from reports to line items. the totals will not match unless you\n\n        only look at items where `\"is_individual\":true` since the same transaction is in the data\n\n        multiple ways to explain the way it may move though different committees as an earmark.\n\n        See the `is_individual` sql function within the migrations for more details.\n\n\n        For the Schedule A aggregates, such as by_occupation and by_state, include only unique individual\n\n        contributions. See below for full methodology.\n\n\n        __Methodology for determining unique, individual contributions__\n\n\n        For receipts over $200 use FEC code line_number to identify individuals.\n\n\n        The line numbers that specify individuals that are automatically included:\n\n\n        Line number with description\n            - 10 Contribution to Independent Expenditure-Only Committees (Super PACs),\n                 Political Committees with non-contribution accounts (Hybrid PACs)\n                 and nonfederal party \"soft money\" accounts (1991-2002)\n                 from a person (individual, partnership, limited liability company,\n                 corporation, labor organization, or any other organization or\n                 group of persons)\n            - 15 Contribution to political committees (other than Super PACs\n                 and Hybrid PACs) from an individual, partnership or\n                 limited liability company\n            - 15E Earmarked contributions to political committees\n                  (other than Super PACs and Hybrid PACs) from an individual,\n                  partnership or limited liability company\n            - 15J Memo - Recipient committee's percentage of contribution\n                  from an individual, partnership or limited liability\n                  company given to joint fundraising committee\n            - 18J | Memo - Recipient committee's percentage of contribution\n                  from a registered committee given to joint fundraising committee\n            - 30, 30T, 31, 31T, 32 Individual party codes\n\n        For receipts under $200:\n\n        We check the following codes and see if there is \"earmark\" (or a variation) in the `memo_text`\n\n        description of the contribution.\n\n\n        Line number with description\n            -11AI The itemized individual contributions from F3 schedule A\n            -12 Nonfederal other receipt - Levin Account (Line 2)\n            -17 Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P\n            -17A Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P\n            -18 Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P\n\n        Of those transactions,[under $200, and having \"earmark\" in the memo text OR transactions having the codes 11A, 12, 17, 17A, or 18], we then want to exclude earmarks.\n\n\n\n        All receipt data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which\n\n        is derived from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form. If no value is supplied, the results\n\n        will default to the most recent two-year period that is named after the ending,\n\n        even-numbered year.\n\n\n        Due to the large quantity of Schedule A filings, this endpoint is not paginated by\n\n        page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in\n\n        the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For\n\n        example, when sorting by `contribution_receipt_date`, you might receive a page of\n\n        results with the following pagination information:\n\n\n        ```\n\n        pagination: {\n            pages: 2152643,\n            per_page: 20,\n            count: 43052850,\n            last_indexes: {\n                last_index: \"230880619\",\n                last_contribution_receipt_date: \"2014-01-01\"\n            }\n        }\n\n        ```\n\n\n        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230880619` and\n\n        `last_contribution_receipt_date=2014-01-01` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through\n\n        these results by using sort indices (defaults to sort by contribution date), otherwise some resources may be\n\n        unintentionally filtered out.

For\n\n        example, when sorting by `disbursement_date`, you might receive a page of\n\n        results with the following pagination information:\n\n\n        ```\n\n        pagination: {\n            pages: 965191,\n            per_page: 20,\n            count: 19303814,\n            last_indexes: {\n                last_index: \"230906248\",\n                last_disbursement_date: \"2014-07-04\"\n            }\n        }\n\n        ```\n\n\n        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230906248` and\n\n        `last_disbursement_date=2014-07-04` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through\n\n        these results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g. `last_disbursement_date`), otherwise\n\n        some resources may be unintentionally filtered out.  This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance\n\n        and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.\n\n\n        Note: because the Schedule B data includes many records, counts for\n\n        large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.\n      parameters:\n        - description: The image number of the page where the schedule item is reported\n          in: query\n          name: image_number\n          required: false\n          explode: true\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              type: string\n        - description: Minimum date\n          in: query\n          name: min_date\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            type: string\n            format: date\n        - in: query\n          name: min_image_number\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: City of recipient\n          in: query\n          name: recipient_city\n          required: false\n          explode: true\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              type: string\n        - description: |\n            The one-letter designation code of the organization:\n                     - A authorized by a candidate\n                     - J joint fundraising committee\n                     - P principal campaign committee of a candidate\n                     - U unauthorized\n                     - B lobbyist/registrant PAC\n                     - D leadership PAC\n          in: query\n          name: spender_committee_designation\n          required: false\n          explode: true\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              enum:\n                - \"\"\n                - A\n                - J\n                - P\n                - U\n                - B\n                - D\n              type: string\n        - description: The FEC identifier should be represented here if the contributor is\n            registered with the FEC.\n          in: query\n          name: recipient_committee_id\n          required: false\n          explode: true\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              type: string\n        - in: query\n          name: max_image_number\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: Index of last result from previous page\n          in: query\n          name: last_index\n          required: false\n          x-nullable: true\n          schema:\n            type: integer\n            format: int32\n        - description: The number of results returned per page.

These figures are\n\n        reported as part of forms F3, F3X and F3P.\n\n\n        The data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which\n\n        is derived from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form.

Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in\n\n        the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For\n\n        example, when sorting by `disbursement_date`, you might receive a page of\n\n        results with the following pagination information:\n\n\n        ```\n\n        pagination: {\n            pages: 965191,\n            per_page: 20,\n            count: 19303814,\n            last_indexes: {\n                last_index: \"230906248\",\n                last_disbursement_date: \"2014-07-04\"\n            }\n        }\n\n        ```\n\n\n        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230906248` and\n\n        `last_disbursement_date=2014-07-04` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through\n\n        these results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g. `last_disbursement_date`), otherwise\n\n        some resources may be unintentionally filtered out.

debts\n  /schedules/schedule_e/:\n    get:\n      description: \u003e\n        \n        Schedule E covers the line item expenditures for independent expenditures. For example, if a super PAC\n\n        bought ads on TV to oppose a federal candidate, each ad purchase would be recorded here with\n\n        the expenditure amount, name and id of the candidate, and whether the ad supported or opposed the candidate.\n\n\n        An independent expenditure is an expenditure for a communication \"expressly advocating the election or\n\n        defeat of a clearly identified candidate that is not made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with,\n\n        or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate’s authorized committee, or their agents, or\n\n        a political party or its agents.\"\n\n\n        Aggregates by candidate do not include 24 and 48 hour reports. This ensures we don't double count expenditures\n\n        and the totals are more accurate. You can still find the information from 24 and 48 hour reports in\n\n        `/schedule/schedule_e/`.\n\n\n        Due to the large quantity of Schedule E filings, this endpoint is not paginated by\n\n        page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in\n\n        the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For\n\n        example, when sorting by `expenditure_amount`, you might receive a page of\n\n        results with the following pagination information:\n\n\n        ```\n         \"pagination\": {\n            \"count\": 152623,\n            \"last_indexes\": {\n              \"last_index\": \"3023037\",\n              \"last_expenditure_amount\": -17348.5\n            },\n            \"per_page\": 20,\n            \"pages\": 7632\n          }\n        }\n\n        ```\n\n\n        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=3023037` and\n\n        `last_expenditure_amount=` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through\n\n        these results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g. `last_disbursement_date`), otherwise\n\n        some resources may be unintentionally filtered out.  This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance\n\n        and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.\n\n\n        Note: because the Schedule E data includes many records, counts for\n\n        large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.\n      parameters:\n        - description: |\n            \n            Name of the entity that received the payment.\n          in: query\n          name: payee_name\n          required: false\n          explode: true\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              type: string\n        - description: The image number of the page where the schedule item is reported\n          in: query\n          name: image_number\n          required: false\n          explode: true\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              type: string\n        - description: \u003e\n            \n            A unique identifier assigned to each candidate registered with the FEC.\n\n            If a person runs for several offices, that person will have separate candidate IDs for each office.\n          in: query\n          name: candidate_id\n          required: false\n          explode: true\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              type: string\n        - description: Minimum date\n          in: query\n          name: min_date\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            type: string\n            format: date\n        - description: Explains if the money was spent in order to support or oppose a\n            candidate or candidates.
