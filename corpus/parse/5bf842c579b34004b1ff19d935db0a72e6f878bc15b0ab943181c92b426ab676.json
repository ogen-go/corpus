Depending on the device used, it is also possible to measure the quality of water such as its electrical conductivity, its salt content, its temperature, etc. In this case, the values measured are processed by the Data Model `WaterObserved` and `WaterQualityObserved`. Additional Information about Attributes: For attributes dedicated to water, a MetaData attribute can also be used. it contains the `TimeStamp` in seconds, the `qualification` and control `status` of the measurement.\n  title: PhreaticObserved\n  version: \"1.0.0\"\nopenapi: \"3.0.0\"\n\npaths: \n  /ngsi-ld/v1/entities: \n    get: \n      description: \"Retrieve a set of entities which matches a specific query from an NGSI-LD system\"\n      parameters: \n        - \n          in: query\n          name: type\n          required: true\n          schema: \n            enum: \n              - PhreaticObserved\n            type: string\n      responses: \n        ? \"200\"\n        : \n          content: \n            application/ld+json: \n              examples: \n                keyvalues: \n                  summary: \"Key-Values Pairs\"\n                  value: \n                    - \n                      $ref: \"https://smart-data-models.github.io/dataModel.Environment/PhreaticObserved/examples/example.json\"\n                normalized: \n                  summary: \"Normalized NGSI-LD\"\n                  value: \n                    - \n                      $ref: \"https://smart-data-models.github.io/dataModel.Environment/PhreaticObserved/examples/example-normalized.jsonld\"\n          description: OK\n      tags: \n        - ngsi-ld\ntags: \n  - \n    description: \"NGSI-LD Linked-data Format\"\n    name: ngsi-ld\n",
