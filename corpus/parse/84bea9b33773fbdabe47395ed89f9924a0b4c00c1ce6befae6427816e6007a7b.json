I had to adjust the XML manually.\\n- Forms can not be\\\n    \\ linked (copy-paste Json of form) (Standalone version).\\n- Camunda Property Infos\\\n    \\ Plugin does not work.\\n- FEEL is missing _**not** myProperty_ - you need to\\\n    \\ do it _myProperty = false_.\\n- CallActivities Input-Mapping were not migrated.\\n\\\n    \\n### What did not work\\n- Forms in the Start Event\\n  - Workaround: Added another\\\n    \\ UserTask \\n  - but with this, it is impossible to have Camunda Processes running\\\n    \\ by itself (no other application must be deployed)\\n- No files\\n  - Workaround:\\\n    \\ only the reference to the file is in the process.\\n- Dynamic content in Form\\\n    \\ Texts (FEEL)\\n- Datastore / Data object reference have no graphic anymore\\n\\n\\\n    ### Cool stuff\\n- Some code completion in FEEL expressions\\n- Links in the Modeller\\\n    \\ to the documentation\\n\\n## Migrating Camundala to Camunda 8\\nThe work to migrate\\\n    \\ the Example concerning:\\n- API Documentation\\n- Test Simulation\\n- Validation\\n\\\n    \\n### API Documentation\\nNothing to do here -
