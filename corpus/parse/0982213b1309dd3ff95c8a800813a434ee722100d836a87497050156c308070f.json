With MediaTailor, you can assemble existing content into a linear stream and serve targeted ads to viewers while maintaining broadcast quality in over-the-top (OTT) video applications. For information about using the service, including detailed information about the settings covered in this guide, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/\">AWS Elemental MediaTailor User Guide</a>.</p> <p>Through the SDKs and the CLI you manage AWS Elemental MediaTailor configurations and channels the same as you do through the console. For example, you specify ad insertion behavior and mapping information for the origin server and the ad decision server (ADS).</p>'\n  x-logo:\n    url: 'https://twitter.com/awscloud/profile_image?size=original'\n    backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF'\n  termsOfService: 'https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/'\n  contact:\n    name: Mike Ralphson\n    email: mike.ralphson@gmail.com\n    url: 'https://github.com/mermade/aws2openapi'\n    x-twitter: PermittedSoc\n  license:\n    name: Apache 2.0 License\n    url: 'http://www.apache.org/licenses/'\n  x-providerName: amazonaws.com\n  x-serviceName: mediatailor\n  x-aws-signingName: mediatailor\n  x-origin:\n    - contentType: application/json\n      url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/mediatailor-2018-04-23.normal.json'\n      converter:\n        url: 'https://github.com/mermade/aws2openapi'\n        version: 1.0.0\n      x-apisguru-driver: external\n  x-apiClientRegistration:\n    url: 'https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html?nc2=h_ct'\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    - cloud\n  x-preferred: true\nexternalDocs:\n  description: Amazon Web Services documentation\n  url: 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/'\nservers:\n  - url: 'http://api.mediatailor.{region}.amazonaws.com'\n    variables:\n      region:\n        description: The AWS region\n        enum:\n          - us-east-1\n          - us-east-2\n          - us-west-1\n          - us-west-2\n          - us-gov-west-1\n          - us-gov-east-1\n          - ca-central-1\n          - eu-north-1\n          - eu-west-1\n          - eu-west-2\n          - eu-west-3\n          - eu-central-1\n          - eu-south-1\n          - af-south-1\n          - ap-northeast-1\n          - ap-northeast-2\n          - ap-northeast-3\n          - ap-southeast-1\n          - ap-southeast-2\n          - ap-east-1\n          - ap-south-1\n          - sa-east-1\n          - me-south-1\n        default: us-east-1\n    description: The MediaTailor multi-region endpoint\n  - url: 'https://api.mediatailor.{region}.amazonaws.com'\n    variables:\n      region:\n        description: The AWS region\n        enum:\n          - us-east-1\n          - us-east-2\n          - us-west-1\n          - us-west-2\n          - us-gov-west-1\n          - us-gov-east-1\n          - ca-central-1\n          - eu-north-1\n          - eu-west-1\n          - eu-west-2\n          - eu-west-3\n          - eu-central-1\n          - eu-south-1\n          - af-south-1\n          - ap-northeast-1\n          - ap-northeast-2\n          - ap-northeast-3\n          - ap-southeast-1\n          - ap-southeast-2\n          - ap-east-1\n          - ap-south-1\n          - sa-east-1\n          - me-south-1\n        default: us-east-1\n    description: The MediaTailor multi-region endpoint\n  - url: 'http://api.mediatailor.{region}.amazonaws.com.cn'\n    variables:\n      region:\n        description: The AWS region\n        enum:\n          - cn-north-1\n          - cn-northwest-1\n        default: cn-north-1\n    description: The MediaTailor endpoint for China (Beijing) and China (Ningxia)\n  - url: 'https://api.mediatailor.{region}.amazonaws.com.cn'\n    variables:\n      region:\n        description: The AWS region\n        enum:\n          - cn-north-1\n          - cn-northwest-1\n        default: cn-north-1\n    description: The MediaTailor endpoint for China (Beijing) and China (Ningxia)\nx-hasEquivalentPaths: true\npaths:\n  '/channel/{channelName}':\n    post:\n      operationId: CreateChannel\n      description: Creates a channel.\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Success\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/CreateChannelResponse'\n      parameters:\n        - name: channelName\n          in: path\n          required: true\n          description: The identifier for the channel you are working on.\n          schema:\n            type: string\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n              required:\n                - Outputs\n                - PlaybackMode\n              properties:\n                FillerSlate:\n                  description: Slate VOD source configuration.\n                  type: object\n                  properties:\n                    SourceLocationName:\n                      allOf:\n                        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/__string'\n                        - description: The name of the source location where the slate VOD source is stored.\n                    VodSourceName:\n                      allOf:\n                        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/__string'\n                        - description: The slate VOD source name.
