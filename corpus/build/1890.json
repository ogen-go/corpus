We would appreciate\n    feedback.\n\n    # Authentication\n\n    When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key.\n    You can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may\n    need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the\n    Rebilly API by providing your secret key in the request header.\n\n    Rebilly offers three forms of authentication:  secret key, publishable key, JSON Web Tokens, and public signature key.\n    - [Secret API key](#section/Authentication/SecretApiKey): used for requests made from the server side. Never share these keys. Keep them guarded and secure\n    - [Publishable API key](#section/Authentication/PublishableApiKey): used for requests from the client side.\n    - [JWT](#section/Authentication/JWT): short lifetime tokens that can be assigned a specific expiration time\n\n    Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.\n\n    \u003c!-- ReDoc-Inject: \u003csecurity-definitions\u003e --\u003e\n\n    ## Javascript SDK\n\n    The [Javascript SDK](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-js-sdk) is maintained\n    within Github, and contains the installation and usage instructions in the Readme file.\n    SDK code examples are included in these docs.\n\ntags:\n  - name: Histograms\n    description: |\n      Histograms are for particular kinds of reports with cohorts and periods.\n  - name: Reports\n    description: \u003e\n      Retrieve summary information about your customers, subscriptions,\n      transactions, and more.\n  - name: Data Exports\n    description: |\n      Data exports.\n  - name: Orders\n  - name: Customers\nsecurity:\n  - SecretApiKey: []\nservers:\n  - url: 'https://api-sandbox.rebilly.com/experimental/organizations/{organizationId}'\n    description: Sandbox server\n    variables:\n      organizationId:\n        default: unknown\n        description: Your organization ID.\n  - url: 'https://api.rebilly.com/experimental/organizations/{organizationId}'\n    description: Live server\n    variables:\n      organizationId:\n        default: unknown\n        description: Your organization ID.\n\ncomponents:\n  securitySchemes:\n    JWT:\n      $ref: components/securitySchemes/JWT.yaml\n    PublishableApiKey:\n      $ref: components/securitySchemes/PublishableApiKey.yaml\n    SecretApiKey:\n      $ref: components/securitySchemes/SecretApiKey.yaml\n\npaths:\n  '/customers/{customerId}/summary-metrics':\n    $ref: './paths/customers@{customerId}@summary-metrics.yaml'\n  /data-exports:\n    $ref: ./paths/data-exports.yaml\n  '/data-exports/{id}':\n    $ref: './paths/data-exports@{id}.yaml'\n  /histograms/transactions:\n    $ref: ./paths/histograms@transactions.yaml\n  /reports/api-log-summary:\n    $ref: ./paths/reports@api-log-summary.yaml\n  /reports/cumulative-subscriptions:\n    $ref: ./paths/reports@cumulative-subscriptions.yaml\n  /reports/dashboard:\n    $ref: ./paths/reports@dashboard.yaml\n  /reports/dcc-markup:\n    $ref: ./paths/reports@dcc-markup.yaml\n  /reports/disputes:\n    $ref: ./paths/reports@disputes.yaml\n  /reports/events-triggered:\n    $ref: ./paths/reports@events-triggered.yaml\n  '/reports/events-triggered/{eventType}/rules':\n    $ref: './paths/reports@events-triggered@{eventType}@rules.yaml'\n  /reports/future-renewals:\n    $ref: ./paths/reports@future-renewals.yaml\n  /reports/renewal-sales:\n    $ref: ./paths/reports@renewal-sales.yaml\n  /reports/retention-percentage:\n    $ref: ./paths/reports@retention-percentage.yaml\n  /reports/retention-value:\n    $ref: ./paths/reports@retention-value.yaml\n  /reports/subscription-cancellation:\n    $ref: ./paths/reports@subscription-cancellation.yaml\n  /reports/subscription-renewal:\n    $ref: ./paths/reports@subscription-renewal.yaml\n  /reports/time-series-transaction:\n    $ref: ./paths/reports@time-series-transaction.yaml\n  /reports/transactions-time-dispute:\n    $ref: ./paths/reports@transactions-time-dispute.yaml\n  /reports/transactions:\n    $ref: ./paths/reports@transactions.yaml\n  '/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/summary-metrics':\n    $ref: './paths/subscriptions@{subscriptionId}@summary-metrics.yaml'\n"
