If there is a name clash, then\n        the API method tries to create a unique name using an integer suffix.\n\n        You can use the **relativePath** field to specify the folder structure to create relative to the node **nodeId**.\n        Folders in the **relativePath** that do not exist are created before the node is created.\n\n        Any other field provided will be treated as a property to set on the newly created node.\n\n        **Note:** setting properties of type d:content and d:category are not supported.\n\n        **Note:** When creating a new node using multipart/form-data by default versioning is enabled and set to MAJOR Version.\n        Since Alfresco 6.2.3 **versioningEnabled** flag was introduced offering better control over the new node Versioning.\n\n        | **versioningEnabled** | **majorVersion** | **Version Type** |\n        |-----------------------|------------------|------------------|\n        |        unset          |        unset     |    MAJOR         |\n        |        unset          |        true      |    MAJOR         |\n        |        unset          |        false     |    MINOR         |\n        |        true           |        unset     |    MAJOR         |\n        |        true           |        true      |    MAJOR         |\n        |        true           |        false     |    MINOR         |\n        |        false          |        true      |    Unversioned   |\n        |        false          |        false     |    Unversioned   |\n        |        false          |        true      |    Unversioned   |\n        \u003cbr\u003e\n\n        **Using JSON**\n\n        You must specify at least a **name** and **nodeType**. For example, to create a folder:\n        ```JSON\n        {\n          \"name\":\"My Folder\",\n          \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\"\n        }\n        ```\n\n        You can create an empty file like this:\n        ```JSON\n        {\n          \"name\":\"My text file.txt\",\n          \"nodeType\":\"cm:content\"\n        }\n        ```\n        You can update binary content using the ```PUT /nodes/{nodeId}``` API method.\n\n        You can create a folder, or other node, inside a folder hierarchy:\n        ```JSON\n        {\n          \"name\":\"My Special Folder\",\n          \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\",\n          \"relativePath\":\"X/Y/Z\"\n        }\n        ```\n        The **relativePath** specifies the folder structure to create relative to the node **nodeId**. Folders in the\n        **relativePath** that do not exist are created before the node is created.\n\n        You can set properties when you create a new node:\n        ```JSON\n        {\n          \"name\":\"My Other Folder\",\n          \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\",\n          \"properties\":\n          {\n            \"cm:title\":\"Folder title\",\n            \"cm:description\":\"This is an important folder\"\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n\n        You can set multi-value properties when you create a new node which supports properties of type multiple.\n         ```JSON\n        {\n          \"name\":\"My Other Folder\",\n          \"nodeType\":\"custom:destination\",\n          \"properties\":\n          {\n            \"cm:title\":\"Folder title\",\n            \"cm:description\":\"This is an important folder\",\n            \"custom:locations\": [\n                                 \"location X\",\n                                 \"location Y\"\n                                ]\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n\n        Any missing aspects are applied automatically. For example, **cm:titled** in the JSON shown above. You can set aspects\n        explicitly, if needed, using an **aspectNames** field.\n\n        **Note:** setting properties of type d:content and d:category are not supported.\n\n        You can also optionally disable (or enable) inherited permissions via *isInheritanceEnabled* flag:\n        ```JSON\n        {\n          \"permissions\":\n            {\n              \"isInheritanceEnabled\": false,\n              \"locallySet\":\n                [\n                  {\"authorityId\": \"GROUP_special\", \"name\": \"Read\", \"accessStatus\":\"DENIED\"},\n                  {\"authorityId\": \"testuser\", \"name\": \"Contributor\", \"accessStatus\":\"ALLOWED\"}\n                ]\n            }\n        }\n        ```\n\n        Typically, for files and folders, the primary children are created within the parent folder using the default \"cm:contains\" assocType.\n        If the content model allows then it is also possible to create primary children with a different assoc type. For example:\n        ```JSON\n        {\n          \"name\":\"My Node\",\n          \"nodeType\":\"my:specialNodeType\",\n          \"association\":\n          {\n            \"assocType\":\"my:specialAssocType\"\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n\n        Additional associations can be added after creating a node. You can also add associations at the time the node is created. This is\n        required, for example, if the content model specifies that a node has mandatory associations to one or more existing nodes. You can optionally\n        specify an array of **secondaryChildren** to create one or more secondary child associations, such that the newly created node acts as a parent node.\n        You can optionally specify an array of **targets** to create one or more peer associations such that the newly created node acts as a source node.\n        For example, to associate one or more secondary children at time of creation:\n        ```JSON\n        {\n          \"name\":\"My Folder\",\n          \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\",\n          \"secondaryChildren\":\n            [ {\"childId\":\"abcde-01234-...\", \"assocType\":\"my:specialChildAssocType\"} ]\n        }\n        ```\n        For example, to associate one or more targets at time of creation:\n        ```JSON\n        {\n          \"name\":\"My Folder\",\n          \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\",\n          \"targets\":\n            [ {\"targetId\":\"abcde-01234-...\", \"assocType\":\"my:specialPeerAssocType\"} ]\n        }\n        ```\n\n        **Note:** You can create more than one child by\n        specifying a list of nodes in the JSON body. For example, the following JSON\n        body creates two folders inside the specified **nodeId**, if the **nodeId** identifies\n        a folder:\n\n        ```JSON\n        [\n          {\n            \"name\":\"My Folder 1\",\n            \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"name\":\"My Folder 2\",\n            \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\"\n          }\n        ]\n        ```\n        If you specify a list as input, then a paginated list rather than an entry is returned in the response body. For example:\n\n        ```JSON\n        {\n          \"list\": {\n            \"pagination\": {\n              \"count\": 2,\n              \"hasMoreItems\": false,\n              \"totalItems\": 2,\n              \"skipCount\": 0,\n              \"maxItems\": 100\n            },\n            \"entries\": [\n              {\n                \"entry\": {\n                  ...\n                }\n              },\n              {\n                \"entry\": {\n                  ...\n                }\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n        **Note:** When creating a new node using JSON by default versioning is disabled.\n        Since Alfresco 6.2.3 **versioningEnabled** flag was introduced offering better control over the new node Versioning.\n\n        | **versioningEnabled** | **majorVersion** | **Version Type** |\n        |-----------------------|------------------|------------------|\n        |        unset          |        unset     |    Unversioned   |\n        |        unset          |        true      |    MAJOR         |\n        |        unset          |        false     |    MINOR         |\n        |        true           |        unset     |    MAJOR         |\n        |        true           |        true      |    MAJOR         |\n        |        true           |        false     |    MINOR         |\n        |        false          |        true      |    Unversioned   |\n        |        false          |        false     |    Unversioned   |\n        |        false          |        true      |    Unversioned   |\n        \u003cbr\u003e\n      operationId: createNode\n      parameters:\n      - name: nodeId\n        in: path\n        description: |\n          The identifier of a node.

More specifically, a node can only be locked if it is\n        of type `cm:content` or a subtype of `cm:content`.\n\n        The lock is owned by the current user, and prevents other users or processes from making updates to the node until the lock is released.\n\n        If the **timeToExpire** is not set or is zero, then the lock never expires.  Otherwise, the **timeToExpire** is the number of seconds before the lock expires.\n\n        When a lock expires, the lock is released.\n\n        If the node is already locked, and the user is the lock owner, then the lock is renewed with the new **timeToExpire**.\n\n        By default, a lock is applied that allows the owner to update or delete the node.\n        You can use **type** to change the lock type to one of the following:\n        * **ALLOW_OWNER_CHANGES** (default) changes to the node can be made only by the lock owner. This enum is the same value as the deprecated WRITE_LOCK described in `org.alfresco.service.cmr.lock.LockType` in the Alfresco Public Java API. This is the default value.\n        * **FULL** no changes by any user are allowed. This enum is the same value as the deprecated READ_ONLY_LOCK described in `org.alfresco.service.cmr.lock.LockType` in the Alfresco Public Java API.\n\n        By default, a lock is persisted in the database. You can create a volatile in-memory lock by setting the **lifetime** property to EPHEMERAL.\n        You might choose use EPHEMERAL locks, for example, if you are taking frequent short-term locks that you don't need\n        to be kept over a restart of the repository. In this case you don't need the\n        overhead of writing the locks to the database.\n\n        If a lock on the node cannot be taken, then an error is returned.\n      operationId: lockNode\n      parameters:\n      - name: nodeId\n        in: path\n        description: The identifier of a node.\n        required: true\n        schema:\n          type: string\n      - name: include\n        in: query\n        description: |\n          Returns additional information about the node.

The **where** parameter takes a value.\n        The value is a single predicate that can include one or more **EXISTS**\n        conditions. The **EXISTS** condition uses a single operand to limit the\n        list to include entries that include that one property. The property values are:\n\n        *   `target/file`\n        *   `target/folder`\n        *   `target/site`\n\n        For example, the following **where** parameter restricts the returned list to the file favorites for a person:\n\n        ```SQL\n        (EXISTS(target/file))\n        ```\n        You can specify more than one condition using **OR**. The predicate must be enclosed in parentheses.\n\n\n        For example, the following **where** parameter restricts the returned list to the file and folder favorites for a person:\n\n        ```SQL\n        (EXISTS(target/file) OR EXISTS(target/folder))\n        ```\n      operationId: listFavorites\n      parameters:\n      - name: personId\n        in: path\n        description: The identifier of a person.\n        required: true\n        schema:\n          type: string\n      - name: skipCount\n        in: query\n        description: |\n          The number of entities that exist in the collection before those included in this list.\n          If not supplied then the default value is 0.\n        schema:\n          minimum: 0\n          type: integer\n          default: 0\n      - name: maxItems\n        in: query\n        description: |\n          The maximum number of items to return in the list.\n          If not supplied then the default value is 100.\n        schema:\n          minimum: 1\n          type: integer\n          default: 100\n      - name: orderBy\n        in: query\n        description: |\n          A string to control the order of the entities returned in a list.

Also, an optional expiry date could be set,\n        so the shared link would become invalid when the expiry date is reached. For example:\n\n        ```JSON\n          {\n            \"nodeId\": \"1ff9da1a-ee2f-4b9c-8c34-3333333333\",\n            \"expiresAt\": \"2017-03-23T23:00:00.000+0000\"\n          }\n        ```\n\n        **Note:** You can create shared links to more than one file\n        specifying a list of **nodeId**s in the JSON body like this:\n\n        ```JSON\n        [\n          {\n            \"nodeId\": \"1ff9da1a-ee2f-4b9c-8c34-4444444444\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"nodeId\": \"1ff9da1a-ee2f-4b9c-8c34-5555555555\"\n          }\n        ]\n        ```\n        If you specify a list as input, then a paginated list rather than an entry is returned in the response body.

See [server documentation].

For example:\n\n        ```\n        {\n          \"actionDefinitionId\": \"copy\",\n          \"targetId\": \"4c4b3c43-f18b-43ff-af84-751f16f1ddfd\",\n          \"params\": {\n            \"destination-folder\": \"34219f79-66fa-4ebf-b371-118598af898c\"\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n\n        Performing a POST with the request body shown above will result in the node identified by ```targetId```\n        being copied to the destination folder specified in the ```params``` object by the key ```destination-folder```.\n\n        **targetId** is optional, however, currently **targetId** must be a valid node ID.\n        In the future, actions may be executed against different entity types or\n        executed without the need for the context of an entity.\n\n\n        Parameters supplied to the action within the ```params``` object will be converted to the expected type,\n        where possible using the DefaultTypeConverter class. In addition:\n\n        * Node IDs may be supplied in their short form (implicit workspace://SpacesStore prefix)\n        * Aspect names may be supplied using their short form, e.g. cm:versionable or cm:auditable\n\n        In this example, we add the aspect ```cm:versionable``` to a node using the QName resolution mentioned above:\n\n        ```\n        {\n          \"actionDefinitionId\": \"add-features\",\n          \"targetId\": \"16349e3f-2977-44d1-93f2-73c12b8083b5\",\n          \"params\": {\n            \"aspect-name\": \"cm:versionable\"\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n\n        The ```actionDefinitionId``` is the ```id``` of an action definition as returned by\n        the _list actions_ operations (e.g. GET /action-definitions).\n\n        The action will be executed **asynchronously** with a `202` HTTP response signifying that\n        the request has been accepted successfully. The response body contains the unique ID of the action\n        pending execution.
