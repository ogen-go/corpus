Party lookup. This facilitates a check by the sending party that the destination party is correct before proceeding with a money movement.\n          2. Quotation.

MSISDN - An MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory\n\n        Number, that is, the phone number) is used as reference to a\n        participant.\n\n        The MSISDN identifier should be in international format according to the\n\n        [ITU-T E.164 standard](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en).\n\n        Optionally, the MSISDN may be prefixed by a single plus sign, indicating\n        the\n\n        international prefix.\n\n        - EMAIL - An email is used as reference to a\n\n        participant. The format of the email should be according to the\n        informational\n\n        [RFC 3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).\n\n        - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as reference to a\n        participant.\n\n        Examples of personal identification are passport number, birth\n        certificate\n\n        number, and national registration number. The identifier number is added\n        in\n\n        the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier type is added in\n        the\n\n        PartySubIdOrType element.\n\n        - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a\n        company)\n\n        is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in\n        any\n\n        format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill\n        number\n\n        in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.\n\n        - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to\n        a\n\n        specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party.\n\n        For referencing a specific device under a specific business or\n        organization,\n\n        use the PartySubIdOrType element.\n\n        - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as\n\n        reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any\n        format,\n\n        as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.\n\n        - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to\n        a\n\n        participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric\n\n        characters and should be entered without whitespace.\n\n        - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should\n        be\n\n        created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.\n\n        Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.\n\n        The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use\n        the\n\n        PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias\n        defined\n\n        by the PartyIdentifier.\n\n        - CONSENT - TBD\n\n        - THIRD_PARTY_LINK - TBD\n      example: PERSONAL_ID\n    PartyIdentifier:\n      title: PartyIdentifier\n      type: string\n      minLength: 1\n      maxLength: 128\n      description: Identifier of the Party.\n    PartySubIdOrType:\n      title: PartySubIdOrType\n      type: string\n      minLength: 1\n      maxLength: 128\n      description: \u003e-\n        Either a sub-identifier of a PartyIdentifier, or a sub-type of the\n        PartyIdType, normally a PersonalIdentifierType.\n    Name:\n      title: Name\n      type: string\n      pattern: '^(?!\\s*$)[\\w .,''-]{1,128}$'\n      description: \u003e-\n        The API data type Name is a JSON String, restricted by a regular\n        expression to avoid characters which are generally not used in a name.\n\n\n        Regular Expression - The regular expression for restricting the Name\n        type is \"^(?!\\s*$)[\\w .,'-]{1,128}$\".
