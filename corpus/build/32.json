The\n        AQHI is calculated based on the relative risks of a combination of common\n        air pollutants that are known to harm human health, including ground-level\n        ozone, particulate matter, and nitrogen dioxide. The AQHI formulation captures\n        only the short term or acute health risk (exposure of hour or days at a maximum).\n        The formulation of the AQHI may change over time to reflect new understanding\n        associated with air pollution health effects. The AQHI is calculated from\n        data observed in real time, without being verified (quality control).\n      operationId: getAqhi-observations-realtimeQueryables\n      parameters:\n      - *id001\n      - *id002\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          $ref: '#/components/responses/Queryables'\n        '400':\n          $ref: https://api.wxod-dev.cmc.ec.gc.ca/schemas/ogcapi/features/part1/1.0/openapi/ogcapi-features-1.yaml#/components/responses/InvalidParameter\n        '404':\n          $ref: https://api.wxod-dev.cmc.ec.gc.ca/schemas/ogcapi/features/part1/1.0/openapi/ogcapi-features-1.yaml#/components/responses/NotFound\n        '500':\n          $ref: https://api.wxod-dev.cmc.ec.gc.ca/schemas/ogcapi/features/part1/1.0/openapi/ogcapi-features-1.yaml#/components/responses/ServerError\n      summary: \"Get Air Quality Health Index \\u2013 Observations queryables\"\n      tags:\n      - aqhi-observations-realtime\n  /collections/bulletins-realtime:\n    get:\n      description: Real-time meteorological bulletins (last 140 days)\n      operationId: describeBulletins-realtimeCollection\n      parameters:\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/f'\n      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/lang'\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          $ref: https://api.wxod-dev.cmc.ec.gc.ca/schemas/ogcapi/features/part1/1.0/openapi/ogcapi-features-1.yaml#/components/responses/Collection\n        '400':\n          $ref: https://api.wxod-dev.cmc.ec.gc.ca/schemas/ogcapi/features/part1/1.0/openapi/ogcapi-features-1.yaml#/components/responses/InvalidParameter\n        '404':\n          $ref: https://api.wxod-dev.cmc.ec.gc.ca/schemas/ogcapi/features/part1/1.0/openapi/ogcapi-features-1.yaml#/components/responses/NotFound\n        '500':\n          $ref: https://api.wxod-dev.cmc.ec.gc.ca/schemas/ogcapi/features/part1/1.0/openapi/ogcapi-features-1.yaml#/components/responses/ServerError\n      summary: Get Real-time meteorological bulletins metadata\n      tags:\n      - bulletins-realtime\n  /collections/bulletins-realtime/items:\n    get:\n      description: Real-time meteorological bulletins (last 140 days)\n      operationId: getBulletins-realtimeFeatures\n      parameters:\n      - *id001\n      - *id002\n      - $ref: https://api.wxod-dev.cmc.ec.gc.ca/schemas/ogcapi/features/part1/1.0/openapi/ogcapi-features-1.yaml#/components/parameters/bbox\n      - $ref: https://api.wxod-dev.cmc.ec.gc.ca/schemas/ogcapi/features/part1/1.0/openapi/ogcapi-features-1.yaml#/components/parameters/limit\n      - description: The properties that should be included for each feature.
