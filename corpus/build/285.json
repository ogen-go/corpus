Prefix ids with a tilde (~) and codenames with a colon (\\:).\n\n        - **name:** Every card has a unique name. A name can have many variants. For example, `Berlin`, `berlin`, and `BERLIN!` all refer to the same card. The singularized, lower-cased, underscored variant of a name is called its \"key.\"\n\n        - **id:** Every card stored in the database has a unique numerical id. _Note: some cards, called 'virtual cards', are not stored in the database and therefore do not have a numerical id. For example, the name `Menu+*refer to` identifies a virtual Search card that finds all the cards that refer to the `Menu` card.Because it is based on patterns that apply to all cards with names ending in `+*refer to`, there is no need to store each instance of that pattern._\n\n        - **codename:** Some cards also have special identifiers called \"codenames\". Card names can be edited by Decko users. If these names were used directly in code, then renaming would break that code. Codename identifiers solve this problem by providing persistent readable identifiers. Only cards referred to directly in code have codenames.\n\n      schema:\n        type: string\n        enum:\n        - '{name}'\n        - '~{id}'\n        - ':{codename}'\n    view:\n      name: view\n      in: query\n      required: false\n      schema:\n        type: string\n        enum:\n        - nucleus\n        - atom\n        - molecule\n        - id\n        - codename\n        - name\n        - key\n        - content\n        - type\n        default: molecule\n      description: The view determines the contents of the response JSON.

Note that every card has a type, and the value of this field should be the type card\\'s name. You can alternatively use **type_id** or **type_code** with the type card\\s id\n          or mark respectively.\n\n        - **content:** The card\\'s content (in string form)\n\n        - **subcards** A hash that contains information about additional cards to be handled in the same transaction.
