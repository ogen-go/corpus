Use the `resource` query parameter to indicate the folder you wish to search in (which can be /). \n\n        **Searching for Files and Folders**\n\n        Using the `name` parameter triggers search mode, which will search the entire directory structure under the provided `resource` for files or folders with names matching the provided `name`. This supports wildcard matching such as:\n\n        - \\*Report\\* would find any files or folders with \"Report\" in the name.\n        - Data\\_202?-09-30.xlsx would match items such as \"Data\\_2020-09-30.xlsx\", \"DATA\\_2021-09-30.xlsx\", \"data\\_2022-09-30.xlsx\" etc.\n        - sales\\* would find any files or folders starting with the word \"Sales\"\n        - \\*.csv would locate any files ending in \".csv\"\n        - \\* matches everything within the directory tree starting at your given `resource`\n\n        The search is not case-sensitive. Searching for Clients\\* or clients\\* or CLIENTS\\*, etc. will provide identical results\n\n        If you are using the `name` parameter to run a search, the `type` parameter will be ignored by the server.\n      operationId: listResources\n      parameters:\n        - description: API Key required to make the API call.\n          in: header\n          name: ev-api-key\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: Access token required to make the API call.\n          example: 5dc97cc607985eb8da033220e7447647e7915fbf73808\n          in: header\n          name: ev-access-token\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: Resource identifier to get resources for.

We support three types of shares:\n\n          - A **shared folder** allows you to let outside parties access a folder in your account (including any files and nested subfolders) using just a link. Shared folders can be restricted; e.g. with an expiration date, password, download-only, etc. Shared folders are 'live'; if someone makes a change to a file in your shared folder, it will be immediately reflected in your account, and vice-versa.\n          - A file **send** lets you send one or more files via an easy download link. File sends are different than shared folders because file sends are 'point in time' -- the recipient will get the files as you sent them. If you later make a change to the source file, it will not be updated for the recipient.\n          - A **receive** folder lets you receive files into your account. You can either send users a link, or optionally [embed a customized form](/docs/account/05-file-sharing/05-upload-widget) on your website.\n          \n        **How to send files from your computer using the API**:\n\n        In order to use the API to send files which are not already stored in your account, you'll need to follow a three-step process:\n\n        1. Use the [POST /shares](#operation/addShare) endpoint to set up your send, including password, recipients, expiration, etc. You must include **upload** among the permissions in the `accessMode` and set the `sendingLocalFiles` parameter to **true**. The response that is returned will include a \"meta\" attribute, which contains an **accessToken** attribute. This new access token is valid only for the send.\n        2. Use the [POST /resources/upload](#operation/uploadFile) endpoint to upload your files to the send you've created. The \"/\" path represents the root of the share, not your home directory. **You must send the access token that you received from the first step in the `ev-access-token` header**\n        3. Use the [POST /shares/complete-send/{id}](#operation/completeDirectSend) endpoint to indicate that you have finished uploading files to your send. This will trigger the system to remove the **upload** permission from the share and send any invitation emails you set up in the first step of the process. **You must send YOUR access token in the `ev-access-token` header, not the temporary access token**\n\n        **Setting the Share Permissions**\n\n        Only 5 different combinations of permissions are valid for the `accessMode` object:\n\n        - **Upload Only**: This allows share visitors to upload to a share but do nothing else to the contained files. To use this mode, set `upload` to **true** and all other permissions to **false**\n        - **Download Only**: This allows share visitors to download files from a share but do nothing else to the contained files. To use this mode, set `download` to **true** and all other permissions to **false**\n        - **Upload and Download**: This allows share visitors to upload new files to the share or download files within the share, but not make any other changes to the share contents. To use this mode, set `upload` and `download` to **true** and set both `modify` and `delete` to **false**\n        - **All but Delete**: This allows share visitors to make any changes to the contents of a share except deleting files. To use this mode, set `upload`, `download`, and `modify` to **true** and set `delete` to **false**\n        - **Full Access**: This allows share visitors to make any changes to the contents of a share. To use this mode, set all 4 permissions `upload`, `download`, `modify`, and `delete` to **true**\n\n        Any other combination of permissions provided as the `accessMode` will be rejected as a bad request.\n\n        **Notes:**\n\n        Authenticated user requires [share permission](/docs/account/04-users/00-introduction#managing-user-roles-and-permissions).\n      operationId: addShare\n      parameters:\n        - description: API Key required to make the API call.\n          example: exampleaccount-zwSuWUZ8S38h33qPS8v0s\n          in: header\n          name: ev-api-key\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: Access token required to make the API call.\n          example: 5dc97cc607985eb8da033220e7447647e7915fbf73808\n          in: header\n          name: ev-access-token\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            examples:\n              example-1:\n                value:\n                  accessMode:\n                    delete: true\n                    download: true\n                    modify: true\n                    upload: true\n                  embed: false\n                  expiration: 2017-09-25T14:12:10Z\n                  fileDropCreateFolders: false\n                  hasNotification: false\n                  isPublic: true\n                  messageBody: null\n                  messageSubject: Invitation to a shared folder\n                  name: Shared Folder\n                  notificationEmails:\n                    - notify@example.com\n                    - notify2@example.com\n                  password: null\n                  recipients:\n                    - email: user@example.com\n                      type: string\n                  requireEmail: false\n                  resources:\n                    - /testfolder\n                  sendingLocalFiles: true\n                  type: shared_folder\n            schema:\n              properties:\n                accessMode:\n                  $ref: \"#/components/schemas/AccessMode\"\n                embed:\n                  description: Whether this share can be embedded within a web page.\n                  example: false\n                  type: boolean\n                expiration:\n                  description: Expiration date for the share.

If you are not sending files from your own computer in a send, you will not need this step.\n          \n        **How to send files from your computer using the API**:\n\n        In order to use the API to send files which are not already stored in your account, you'll need to follow a three-step process:\n\n        1. Use the [POST /shares](#operation/addShare) endpoint to set up your send, including password, recipients, expiration, etc. You must include **upload** among the permissions in the `accessMode` and set the `sendingLocalFiles` paramter to **true**. The response that is returned will include a \"meta\" attribute, which contains an **accessToken** attribute. This new access token is valid only for the send.\n        2. Use the [POST /resources/upload](#operation/uploadFile) endpoint to upload your files to the send you've created. The \"/\" path represents the root of the share, not your home directory. **You must send the access token that you received from the first step in the `ev-access-token` header**\n        3. Use the [POST /shares/complete-send/{id}](#operation/completeDirectSend) endpoint to indicate that you have finished uploading files to your send. This will trigger the system to remove the **upload** permission from the share and send any invitation emails you set up in the first step of the process. **You must send YOUR access token in the `ev-access-token` header, not the temporary access token**\n      operationId: completeDirectSend\n      parameters:\n        - description: API Key\n          in: header\n          name: ev-api-key\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            example: exampleaccount-zwSuWUZ8S38h33qPS8v0s\n            type: string\n        - description: Access Token\n          in: header\n          name: ev-access-token\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            example: 19853ef63a0bc348024a9e4cfd4a92520d2dfd04e88d8679fb1ed6bc551593d1\n            type: string\n        - description: ID of the share to trigger invitations for.\n          in: path\n          name: id\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: integer\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/ShareResponse\"\n          description: Successful operation\n      summary: Complete send files\n      tags:\n        - Shares\n  \"/shares/{id}\":\n    delete:\n      description: |-\n        Deactivate a share. Deactivating a share does not remove the underlying files for **shared_folder** and **receive** share types; it merely removes the access URL.

To use this mode, set `upload` to **true** and all other permissions to **false**\n        - **Download Only**: This allows share visitors to download files from a share but do nothing else to the contained files. To use this mode, set `download` to **true** and all other permissions to **false**\n        - **Upload and Download**: This allows share visitors to upload new files to the share or download files within the share, but not make any other changes to the share contents. To use this mode, set `upload` and `download` to **true** and set both `modify` and `delete` to **false**\n        - **All but Delete**: This allows share visitors to make any changes to the contents of a share except deleting files. To use this mode, set `upload`, `download`, and `modify` to **true** and set `delete` to **false**\n        - **Full Access**: This allows share visitors to make any changes to the contents of a share. To use this mode, set all 4 permissions `upload`, `download`, `modify`, and `delete` to **true**\n\n        Any other combination of permissions provided as the `accessMode` will be rejected as a bad request.\n\n        **Notes:**\n\n          - Authenticated user should be the owner of the specified share.\n      operationId: updateShareById\n      parameters:\n        - description: API Key\n          in: header\n          name: ev-api-key\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            example: exampleaccount-zwSuWUZ8S38h33qPS8v0s\n            type: string\n        - description: Access Token\n          in: header\n          name: ev-access-token\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            example: 19853ef63a0bc348024a9e4cfd4a92520d2dfd04e88d8679fb1ed6bc551593d1\n            type: string\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            examples:\n              example-1:\n                value:\n                  accessMode:\n                    delete: true\n                    download: true\n                    modify: true\n                    upload: true\n                  embed: false\n                  expiration: 2017-09-25T14:12:10Z\n                  fileDropCreateFolders: false\n                  hasNotification: false\n                  isPublic: true\n                  messageBody: null\n                  messageSubject: Invitation to a shared folder\n                  name: Shared Folder\n                  notificationEmails:\n                    - notify@example.com\n                    - notify2@example.com\n                  password: null\n                  recipients:\n                    - email: user@example.com\n                      type: string\n                  requireEmail: false\n                  resources:\n                    - /testfolder\n                  status: 0\n            schema:\n              properties:\n                accessMode:\n                  $ref: \"#/components/schemas/AccessMode\"\n                embed:\n                  description: Whether the share can be embedded in another web page.\n                  example: false\n                  type: boolean\n                expiration:\n                  description: New expiration date and time for the share\n                  example: 2017-09-25T14:12:10Z\n                  format: date-time\n                  type: string\n                fileDropCreateFolders:\n                  description: Whether uploads to a receive folder should be automatically placed into subfolders.

If you provide the `username` parameter in your call, then only the user who exactly matches that username will be in the list of matches. Any other parameters are ignored.\n        1. Search for a user by individual filter fields (`nickname`,`email`,`role`,`status`,`homeDir`). Users in the list will be ones who match all of the filters you choose to search by. For example, you could look for users with the \"admin\" `role` AND `email` addresses ending in \"*@acme.com\". \n        1. Search for a user by search string. If you provide the `search` parameter, users whose nickname OR email OR role OR homeDir match value your provide.\n\n        **Notes:**\n\n        - You must be an [admin-level user](/docs/account/04-users/00-introduction#managing-user-roles-and-permissions) to use this.\n        - The homeDir is the full path to the user's home directory, not a resource ID or hash.\n      operationId: listUsers\n      parameters:\n        - description: API key required to make the API call.\n          in: header\n          name: ev-api-key\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: Access token required to make the API call.\n          example: 5dc97cc607985eb8da033220e7447647e7915fbf73808\n          in: header\n          name: ev-access-token\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: The username of the user you are looking for.
