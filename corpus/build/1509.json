In particular, services implementing GA4GH specifications defined in OAS format (as per the `type` field) should respond to requests constructed by appending relative paths from the specification to this base URL (e.g. `{url}/service-info`). See [API Server and Base URL](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/api-host-and-base-path/) for more information on specifying base URLs in OAS 3.\n              example: 'https://api.example.com/v1'\n          required:\n            - url\n    ServiceType:\n      $ref: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ga4gh-discovery/ga4gh-service-info/v1.0.0/service-info.yaml#/components/schemas/ServiceType'\n    Error:\n      type: object\n      properties:\n        status:\n          type: integer\n          format: int32\n          description: |\n            HTTP status code (as per [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231)) generated by the server for this occurrence of the problem.\n\n            This must match the status code in the actual HTTP response. Used for convenience of clients (e.g. to determine what the original status code was in cases where it has been changed by an intermediary or cache or when message bodies persist without HTTP information).\n          example: '500'\n        title:\n          type: string\n          description: |\n            A short, human-readable description of the error.\n\n            The value should not change from occurrence to occurrence of an error, except for purposes of localization.\n          example: 'Internal server error'\n        detail:\n          type: string\n          description: 'A human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the error.'\n          example: 'Internal server error'\n      required:\n        - status\n        - title"
