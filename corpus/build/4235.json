Optional for each bank to implement.\n      * Decoupled SCA Approach\n      * Embedded SCA Approach without SCA method\n      * Embedded SCA Approach with only one SCA method available\n      * Embedded SCA Approach with Selection of a SCA method\n\n      Not every message defined in this API definition is necessary for all approaches.\n      Furthermore this API definition does not differ between methods which are mandatory, conditional, or optional\n      Therefore for a particular implementation of a Berlin Group PSD2 compliant API it is only necessary to support\n      a certain subset of the methods defined in this API definition.\n\n      **Please have a look at the implementation guidelines if you are not sure\n      which message has to be used for the approach you are going to use.**\n\n    ## Some General Remarks Related to this version of the OpenAPI Specification:\n    * **This API definition is based on the Implementation Guidelines of the Berlin Group PSD2 API.**\n      It is not an replacement in any sense.\n      The main specification is (at the moment) always the Implementation Guidelines of the Berlin Group PSD2 API.\n    * **This API definition contains the REST-API for requests from the PISP to the ASPSP.**\n    * **This API definition contains the messages for all different approaches defined in the Implementation Guidelines.**\n    * According to the OpenAPI-Specification [https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md]\n\n        \"If in is \"header\" and the name field is \"Accept\", \"Content-Type\" or \"Authorization\", the parameter definition SHALL be ignored.\"\n\n      The element \"Accept\" will not be defined in this file at any place.\n\n      The elements \"Content-Type\" and \"Authorization\" are implicitly defined by the OpenApi tags \"content\" and \"security\".\n\n    * There are several predefined types which might occur in payment initiation messages,\n      but are not used in the standard JSON messages in the Implementation Guidelines.\n      Therefore they are not used in the corresponding messages in this file either.\n      We added them for the convenience of the user.\n      If there is a payment product, which needs these fields, one can easily use the predefined types.\n      But the ASPSP need not to accept them in general.\n\n    * **We omit the definition of all standard HTTP header elements (mandatory/optional/conditional)\n      except they are mentioned in the Implementation Guidelines.**\n      Therefore the implementer might add these in his own realisation of a PSD2 comlient API in addition to the elements defined in this file.\n\n    ## General Remarks on Data Types\n\n    The Berlin Group definition of UTF-8 strings in context of the PSD2 API has to support at least the following characters\n\n    a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z\n\n    A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n    / -

Payment products with payment information in *JSON* format:\n            - ***sepa-credit-transfers***\n            - ***cross-border-credit-transfers***\n\n        Furthermore the request body depends on the **payment-service**:\n          * ***payments***: A single payment initiation request.\n          * ***bulk-payments***: A collection of several payment initiation requests.\n\n            In case of a *pain.001* message there are more than one payments contained in the *pain.001 message.\n\n            In case of a *JSON* there are several JSON payment blocks contained in a joining list.\n          * ***periodic-payments***:\n            Create a standing order initiation resource for recurrent i.e. periodic payments addressable under {paymentId}\n             with all data relevant for the corresponding payment product and the execution of the standing order contained in a JSON body.\n\n        This is the first step in the API to initiate the related recurring/periodic payment.\n\n        ## Single and mulitilevel SCA Processes\n\n        The payment initiation requests are independent from the need of one or multilevel\n        SCA processing, i.e. independent from the number of authorisations needed for the execution of payments.\n\n        But the response messages are specific to either one SCA processing or multilevel SCA processing.\n\n        For payment initiation with multilevel SCA, this specification requires an explicit start of the authorisation,\n        i.e. links directly associated with SCA processing like 'scaRedirect' or 'scaOAuth' cannot be contained in the\n        response message of a Payment Initation Request for a payment, where multiple authorisations are needed.\n        Also if any data is needed for the next action, like selecting an SCA method is not supported in the response,\n        since all starts of the multiple authorisations are fully equal.\n        In these cases, first an authorisation sub-resource has to be generated following the 'startAuthorisation' link.\n      operationId: initiatePayment\n      tags:\n        -
