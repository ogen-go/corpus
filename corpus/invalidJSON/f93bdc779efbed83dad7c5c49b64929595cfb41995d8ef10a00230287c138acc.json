All URLs are user-friendly and resource-oriented, using HTTP protocol\\nstandards like authentication, verbs and return codes.\\n\\nAs can be seen below, the APIs have been carefully crafted so that the business terms contained within are easily understood by developers who have no prior knowledge of the system. They have been meticulously studied so that a field name in an endpoint has exactly the same meaning in other resources.\\n\\n\\n# Authentication\\n\\n All communication (receiving and sending data) uses tokens for authentication. See\\n the table below for tokens and streams:\\n\\n | Header | Flow |\\n | 🇧🇷 - |\\n |`x-picpay-token` | E-Commerce requests for PicPay.|\\n |`x-seller-token` | PicPay requests for E-Commerce (Callback).|\\n\\n *Both tokens will be provided by PicPay, after completing the store registration.*\\n\\n\\n# Test environment\\n\\n Currently PicPay does not have a homologation environment for customer integration tests. All\\n validations must be carried out in production, **without charge to the developer.** \\n Payments made during testing can be immediately reversed, by the API\\n or [merchant's panel](https:/ /painel-empresas.picpay.com/).\\n\\n\\n # Support\\n If you have any questions, consult our FAQ or contact the PicPay Empresas relationship center by email ** contato-empresas@picpay.com.**\\n\\n\\n **Information:** PicPay's development team does not provide consulting services, therefore, no\\n codes are analyzed in our support.\\n \"\n  },\n  \"tags\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Create an order for a payment\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Capture payment\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Payment Cancel request\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Order Check Status\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Order change notification\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"paths\": {\n    \"/payments\": {\n      \"post\": {\n        \"tags\": [\n          \"Create an order for a payment\"\n        ],\n        \"description\": \"\\nThe creation of the payment request is performed at checkout, on the payment screen.

There will be no \\n visual difference between the online store and the payment page.\\n\\nThe identification process of the consumer in the PicPay database is based on the information \\ncontained in the `buyer` field.
