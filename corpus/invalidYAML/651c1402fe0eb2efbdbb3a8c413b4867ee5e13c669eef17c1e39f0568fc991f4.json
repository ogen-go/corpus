You can use the same integration for payments made with cards (including 3D Secure), mobile wallets, and local payment methods (for example, iDEAL and Sofort).\n\n    This API reference provides information on available endpoints and how to interact with them. To learn more about the API, visit [Checkout documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments).\n\n    ## Authentication\n    Each request to the Checkout API must be signed with an API key. For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n    ```\n    curl\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -H \"X-API-Key: Your_Checkout_API_key\" \\\n    ...\n    ```\n    Note that when going live, you need to generate a new API Key to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n    ## Versioning\n    Checkout API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\n    For example:\n    ```\n    https://checkout-test.adyen.com/v40/payments\n    ```\n  termsOfService: https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions\n  title: Adyen Checkout API\n  version: \"40\"\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    - payment\n  x-logo:\n    url: https://adyen.com/.resources/adyen-website/themes/images/apple-icon-180x180.png\n  x-origin:\n    - format: openapi\n      url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adyen/adyen-openapi/master/json/CheckoutService-v40.json\n      version: \"3.1\"\n  x-preferred: false\n  x-providerName: adyen.com\n  x-publicVersion: true\n  x-serviceName: CheckoutService\npaths:\n  /cancels:\n    post:\n      description: |-\n        Cancels the authorisation on a payment that has not yet been [captured](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/captures), and returns a unique reference for this request. You get the outcome of the request asynchronously, in a [**TECHNICAL_CANCEL** webhook](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/cancel#cancellation-webhook).\n\n        If you want to cancel a payment using the [`pspReference`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments__resParam_pspReference), use the [`/payments/{paymentPspReference}/cancels`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/cancels) endpoint instead.\n\n        If you want to cancel a payment but are not sure whether it has been captured, use the [`/payments/{paymentPspReference}/reversals`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/reversals) endpoint instead.\n\n        For more information, refer to [Cancel](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/cancel).\n      operationId: post-cancels\n      parameters:\n        - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/Idempotency-Key\"\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: \"#/components/schemas/CreateStandalonePaymentCancelRequest\"\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/StandalonePaymentCancelResource\"\n          description: OK - the request has succeeded.\n          headers:\n            Idempotency-Key:\n              $ref: \"#/components/headers/Idempotency-Key\"\n        \"201\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/StandalonePaymentCancelResource\"\n          description: Created - the request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created.\n          headers:\n            Idempotency-Key:\n              $ref: \"#/components/headers/Idempotency-Key\"\n        \"400\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              examples:\n                generic:\n                  $ref: \"#/components/examples/generic-400\"\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/ServiceError\"\n          description: Bad Request - a problem reading or understanding the request.\n        \"401\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              examples:\n                generic:\n                  $ref: \"#/components/examples/generic-401\"\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/ServiceError\"\n          description: Unauthorized - authentication required.\n        \"403\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              examples:\n                generic:\n                  $ref: \"#/components/examples/generic-403\"\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/ServiceError\"\n          description: Forbidden - insufficient permissions to process the request.\n        \"422\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              examples:\n                generic:\n                  $ref: \"#/components/examples/generic-422\"\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/ServiceError\"\n          description: Unprocessable Entity - a request validation error.\n          headers:\n            Idempotency-Key:\n              $ref: \"#/components/headers/Idempotency-Key\"\n        \"500\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              examples:\n                generic:\n                  $ref: \"#/components/examples/generic-500\"\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/ServiceError\"\n          description: Internal Server Error - the server could not process the request.\n      security:\n        - BasicAuth: []\n        - ApiKeyAuth: []\n      summary: Cancels an authorised payment.\n      tags:\n        - Modifications\n      x-groupName: Modifications\n      x-sortIndex: 3\n  /orders:\n    post:\n      description: Creates an order to be used for partial payments.

However, making capture requests for payments that are captured automatically does not result in double charges.\n\n        For more information, refer to [Capture](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/capture).\n      operationId: post-payments-paymentPspReference-captures\n      parameters:\n        - description: The [`pspReference`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments__resParam_pspReference) of the payment that you want to capture.\n          in: path\n          name: paymentPspReference\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/Idempotency-Key\"\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: \"#/components/schemas/CreatePaymentCaptureRequest\"\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/PaymentCaptureResource\"\n          description: OK - the request has succeeded.\n          headers:\n            Idempotency-Key:\n              $ref: \"#/components/headers/Idempotency-Key\"\n        \"201\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/PaymentCaptureResource\"\n          description: Created - the request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created.\n          headers:\n            Idempotency-Key:\n              $ref: \"#/components/headers/Idempotency-Key\"\n        \"400\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              examples:\n                generic:\n                  $ref: \"#/components/examples/generic-400\"\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/ServiceError\"\n          description: Bad Request - a problem reading or understanding the request.\n        \"401\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              examples:\n                generic:\n                  $ref: \"#/components/examples/generic-401\"\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/ServiceError\"\n          description: Unauthorized - authentication required.\n        \"403\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              examples:\n                generic:\n                  $ref: \"#/components/examples/generic-403\"\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/ServiceError\"\n          description: Forbidden - insufficient permissions to process the request.\n        \"422\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              examples:\n                generic:\n                  $ref: \"#/components/examples/generic-422\"\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/ServiceError\"\n          description: Unprocessable Entity - a request validation error.\n          headers:\n            Idempotency-Key:\n              $ref: \"#/components/headers/Idempotency-Key\"\n        \"500\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              examples:\n                generic:\n                  $ref: \"#/components/examples/generic-500\"\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/ServiceError\"\n          description: Internal Server Error - the server could not process the request.\n      security:\n        - BasicAuth: []\n        - ApiKeyAuth: []\n      summary: Captures an authorised payment.\n      tags:\n        - Modifications\n      x-groupName: Modifications\n      x-sortIndex: 1\n  \"/payments/{paymentPspReference}/refunds\":\n    post:\n      description: |-\n        Refunds a payment that has been [captured](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/captures), and returns a unique reference for this request.
