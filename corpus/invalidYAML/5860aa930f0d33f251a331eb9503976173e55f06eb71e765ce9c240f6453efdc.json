You can use the API to accept card payments (including One-Click and 3D Secure), bank transfers, ewallets, and many other payment methods.\n\n    To learn more about the API, visit [Classic integration](https://docs.adyen.com/classic-integration).\n\n    ## Authentication\n    To connect to the Payments API, you must use your basic authentication credentials. For this, create your web service user, as described in [How to get the WS user password](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:\n\n    ```\n    curl\n    -U \"ws@Company.YourCompany\":\"YourWsPassword\" \\\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    ...\n    ```\n    Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n    ## Versioning\n    Payments API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\n    For example:\n    ```\n    https://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Payment/v46/authorise\n    ```\n  termsOfService: https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions\n  title: Adyen Payment API\n  version: \"46\"\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    - payment\n  x-logo:\n    url: https://twitter.com/Adyen/profile_image?size=original\n  x-origin:\n    - converter:\n        url: https://github.com/mermade/oas-kit\n        version: 7.0.4\n      format: openapi\n      url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adyen/adyen-openapi/master/json/PaymentService-v46.json\n      version: \"3.1\"\n  x-preferred: false\n  x-providerName: adyen.com\n  x-publicVersion: true\n  x-serviceName: PaymentService\npaths:\n  /adjustAuthorisation:\n    post:\n      description: |-\n        Allows you to increase or decrease the authorised amount after the initial authorisation has taken place.
