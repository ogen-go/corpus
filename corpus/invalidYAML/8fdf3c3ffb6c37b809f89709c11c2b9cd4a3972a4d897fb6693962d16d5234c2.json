If you don't have the required API credentials, contact our [Support Team](https://support.adyen.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\n    Both of these API credentials must be authenticated with [basic authentication](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#basic-authentication).The following example shows how to authenticate your request when submitting a payout:\n\n    ```\n    curl\n    -U \"storePayout@Company.[YourCompany]\":\"YourBasicAuthenticationPassword\" \\\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    ...\n    ```\n    When going live, you need to generate new API credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n  termsOfService: https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions\n  title: Adyen Payout API\n  version: \"64\"\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    -
