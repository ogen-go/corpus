The Self-Serve API documented here may be suitable for internal prototyping and other exploratory work.\n\n    If you are developing a non-commercial plugin application or personal project, we recommend you make use of the Self-Serve API documented here under the API Terms Of Use. Please be aware that our Self-Serve API has conservative rate and access limits, which are subject to change at any time and not well suited to commercial projects. If this is a problem for your use case, please contact us at developers@splitwise.com to discuss your needs.\n\n    All Self-Service API users are subject to the API Terms of Use below.\n\n    ## TERMS OF USE\n\n    These API Terms of Use describe your rights and responsibilities when accessing our publicly available Application Programming Interface (API) and related API documentation. Please review them carefully.\n\n    Splitwise may modify this Agreement at any time by posting a revised version on our website. The revised version will be effective at the time that it is posted. \n\n    These API terms form a binding contract between you and us.

For example, some users use a Group to aggregate expenses related to an apartment. Others use it to represent a trip.\n      Expenses assigned to a group are split among the users of that group.\n      Importantly, two users in a Group can also have expenses with one another outside of the Group.\n  - name: friends\n    x-displayName: Friends\n  - name: expenses\n    x-displayName: Expenses\n  - name: comments\n    x-displayName: Comments\n  - name: notifications\n    x-displayName: Notifications\n  - name: other\n    x-displayName: Other\npaths:\n  $ref: ./paths/index.yaml\n\ncomponents:\n  securitySchemes:\n    OAuth:\n      type: oauth2\n      description: |\n        Splitwise uses OAuth 2 with the authorization code flow. To connect via OAuth 2, you'll need to [register your app](https://secure.splitwise.com/apps). When you register, you'll be given a key and secret.\n\n        **Note**: OAuth can be a very confusing protocol to implement correctly, and we **strongly** recommend\n        that you use an existing OAuth library to connect to Splitwise. You can find a list of OAuth client libraries at the\n        [OAuth community site](https://oauth.net/code/#client-libraries).\n\n        For more information on using OAuth, check out the following resources:\n\n        - The OAuth community [getting started guide](https://oauth.net/getting-started/)\n        - The oauth.com [OAuth 2.0 playground](https://www.oauth.com/playground/) (great for debugging authorization issues)\n        - This [old Splitwise blog post](https://blog.splitwise.com/2013/07/15/setting-up-oauth-for-the-splitwise-api/) about OAuth\n      flows:\n        authorizationCode:\n          authorizationUrl: /oauth/authorize\n          tokenUrl: /oauth/token\n          scopes: {}\n    ApiKeyAuth:\n      type: http\n      description:\n        For speed and ease of prototyping, you can generate a personal API key on your app's details page. You should present this key to the server via the Authorization header as a Bearer token. The API key is an access token for your personal account, so keep it as safe as you would a password.\n\n        If your key becomes compromised or you want to invalidate your existing key for any other reason, you can do so on the app details page by generating a new key.\n      scheme: bearer\n      bearerFormat: API key\n  responses:\n    Unauthorized:\n      $ref: ./responses/unauthorized.yaml\n    Forbidden:\n      $ref: ./responses/forbidden.yaml\n    Not Found:\n      $ref: ./responses/not_found.yaml\n  schemas:\n    Debt:\n      $ref: ./schemas/debt.yaml\n    User:\n      $ref: ./schemas/user.yaml\n    CurrentUser:\n      $ref: ./schemas/current_user.yaml\n    NotificationSettings:\n      $ref: ./schemas/notification_settings.yaml\n    Group:\n      $ref: ./schemas/group.yaml\n    UnauthorizedError:\n      $ref: ./schemas/errors/unauthorized.yaml\n    ForbiddenError:\n      $ref: ./schemas/errors/forbidden.yaml\n    NotFoundError:\n      $ref: ./schemas/errors/not_found.yaml\n"
