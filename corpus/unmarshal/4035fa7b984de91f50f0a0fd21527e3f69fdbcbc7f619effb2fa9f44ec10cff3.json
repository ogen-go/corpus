Read through the getting \n    started section before you dive in. Most of your problems should be solved \n    just by reading through it.\n\n    ## Getting Started\n\n    Let's make our first API request to the D\u0026D 5th Edition API!\n\n    Open up a terminal and use [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) or [httpie](http://httpie.org/) \n    to make an API request for a resource. You can also scroll through the\n    definitions below and send requests directly from the endpoint documentation!\n\n    For example, if you paste and run this `curl` command:\n    ```bash\n    curl -X GET \"https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/ability-scores/cha\" -H \"Accept: application/json\"\n    ```\n\n    We should see a result containing details about the Charisma ability score:\n    ```bash\n    {\n      \"index\": \"cha\",\n      \"name\": \"CHA\",\n      \"full_name\": \"Charisma\",\n      \"desc\": [\n        \"Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It \n          includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent \n          a charming or commanding personality.\",\n        \"A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain \n          others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, \n          or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, \n          Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in \n          certain kinds of Charisma checks.\"\n      ],\n      \"skills\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Deception\",\n          \"index\": \"deception\",\n          \"url\": \"/api/skills/deception\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Intimidation\",\n          \"index\": \"intimidation\",\n          \"url\": \"/api/skills/intimidation\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Performance\",\n          \"index\": \"performance\",\n          \"url\": \"/api/skills/performance\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Persuasion\",\n          \"index\": \"persuasion\",\n          \"url\": \"/api/skills/persuasion\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"url\": \"/api/ability-scores/cha\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Authentication \n\n    The dnd5eapi is a completely open API. No authentication is required to query \n    and get data. This also means that we've limited what you can do to just \n    `GET`-ing the data. If you find a mistake in the data, feel free to \n    [message us](https://discord.gg/TQuYTv7).\n\n    ## GraphQL\n\n    This API supports [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). The GraphQL URL for this API\n    is `https://www.dnd5eapi.co/graphql`. GraphQL functionality is not covered in \n    this documentation.\n\n    ## Schemas\n\n    Definitions of all schemas will be accessible in a future update. Two of the most common schemas are described here.\n\n    ### `APIReference`\n    Represents a minimal representation of a resource. The detailed representation of the referenced resource can be retrieved by making a request to the referenced `URL`.\n    ```\n    APIReference {\n      index     string    \n      name      string    \n      url       string   \n    }\n    ```\n    \u003chr\u003e\n\n    ### `Choice`\n    Represents a choice made by a player. Commonly seen related to decisions made during character creation or combat (e.g.: the description of the cleric class, under **Proficiencies**, states \"Skills: Choose two from\tHistory, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and\tReligion\" [[SRD p15]](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf#page=15))\n    ```\n    Choice {\n      choose    number            \n      type      string            \n      from      [APIReference]   \n    }\n    ```\n\n    # Status Page\n\n    The status page for the API can be found here: https://5e-bits.github.io/dnd-uptime/\n\n    # Chat \n\n    Come hang out with us [on Discord](https://discord.gg/TQuYTv7)!\n\n    # Contribute\n\n    This API is built from two repositories.\n      - The repo containing the data lives here: https://github.com/bagelbits/5e-database\n      - The repo with the API implementation lives here: https://github.com/bagelbits/5e-srd-api \n\n    This is a evolving API and having fresh ideas are always welcome! You can \n    open an issue in either repo, open a PR for changes, or just discuss with \n    other users in this discord.\n\n    # Legacy Documentation\n\n    This documentation page is new!
