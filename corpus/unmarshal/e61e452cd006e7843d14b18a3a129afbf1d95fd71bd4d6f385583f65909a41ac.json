The API will look for the key in the \"api_key\" header of the request. \u003ca href=\"https://voodoomfg.com/3d-print-api#get-access\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYou can request a key here.\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\n    This API provides a programmatic interface for submitting printing orders to Voodoo Manufacturing. The general process for creating an order is as follows:\n      - Get a list of the available materials with the /materials endpoint\n      - Upload models to the API with the /models endpoint\n      - Get quotes for shipping methods with the /order/shipping endpoint\n      - Get a quote for an order with the /order/create endpoint\n      - Confirm the order with the /order/confirm endpoint\n\n    Uploaded models and orders can be retrieved either in bulk or by id at the /model and /order endpoints, respectively.\n\n\n    In some cases, you may wish to get a quote for a specific model without the context of an order. In this case, you may use the /model/quote (if you've already uploaded the model to the API) or the /model/quote_attrs (lets you quote based on calculated model attributes) endpoints.\n  title: Voodoo Manufacturing 3D Print\n  version: 2.0.0\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    - tools\n  x-logo:\n    url: https://twitter.com/voodoomfg/profile_image?size=original\n  x-origin:\n    - format: swagger\n      url: https://api.voodoomfg.com/voodoo.yaml\n      version: \"2.0\"\n  x-providerName: voodoomfg.com\nsecurity:\n  - Voodoo_Manufacturing_API_Key: []\npaths:\n  /materials:\n    get:\n      description: \u003e\n        The Materials endpoint returns a list of materials that are currently\n        available for production for your account.\n\n        The responses include display details about each material, along with the unique id required to request a print in a specific material.\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: Array of materials\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                items:\n                  $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Material\"\n                type: array\n              examples:\n                response:\n                  value:\n                    - color: True Red\n                      color_sample: \"#CF1B1D\"\n                      id: 1\n                      type: PLA\n                    - color: True Brown\n                      color_sample: \"#995D15\"\n                      id: 2\n                      type: PLA\n      summary: \u003e\n        Voodoo Manufacturing offers printing in a number of different materials,\n        with different color options for each.
