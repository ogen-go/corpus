EPS is the national service used to send electronic prescription messages between prescribers and community dispensers.\n\n    ### Prescribers in primary and secondary care can: \n    * create a prescription\n    * encode data so the prescription is ready to sign\n    * cancel a prescription\n    \n    Creating and cancelling a prescription are both done by the prescriber. Encoding data so the prescription is ready to sign is done by the prescribing system.\n  \n    ### Dispensers can:\n    * download an individual prescription from EPS\n    * download a batch of prescriptions from EPS\n    * verify a prescription's signature\n    * return a prescription to EPS\n    * submit a dispense notification to EPS\n    * withdraw a dispense notification from EPS\n    * submit a dispense claim\n    \n    You cannot currently use this API to:\n    * view a prescription's detailed dispense history\n\n    ## Who can use this API\n      This API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have a [valid use case](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service/enabling-eps-for-your-service) before you go too far with your development. \n\n    You must get approval before you can go live. For more information, see the 'Onboarding' section.\n\n    ## Related APIs, services and documentation\n       \n    ### Services\n    These services must be used to create a functioning system using EPS that meets assurance standards. \n    * [Care Identity Serice 2 (CIS2)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/identity-and-access-management/national-care-identity-service) - use this to authenticate prescribers with their smartcard.\n    * [Directory of Services (DOS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/directory-of-services-dos) - prescribers must use the DOS to find dispensing sites for patients.\n    * [Organisation Data Service (ODS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/organisation-data-service-fhir) - use this to access ODS codes for prescribing organisations.\n    * [Personal Demographics Service (PDS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-fhir) - use PDS to synchronise a patient's demographic details including their name, date of birth and address.\n    * [Signing Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/signing-service) - use the signing service API to create signatures for prescriptions. The signing service is only used for EPS.\n    * [Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/national-rbac-for-developers) - RBAC rules are stored in the National RBAC Database (NRD) and are used to limit what prescribers can and cannot do.\n    * [GP2GP](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/gp2gp) - use the GP2GP service to transfer patient details, including nominated dispensers, between GPs.\n    * [Message Exchange for Social Care and Health (MESH)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-api) - Use MESH to deliver and receive cancel responses.\n    * [Prescription Tracker](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/eps-tracker) - use this if you want a read-only interface to get information about a patient's prescriptions.\n    \n    [EPS HL7 V3](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/electronic-prescription-service-hl7-v3) is also available if you want to use functions that are not yet available on the FHIR API.\n\n    ### Documentation\n    This documentation must be used in the API to meet assurance requirements when integrating with EPS.\n    * [Dictionary of Medicines and Devices (DM+D)](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pharmacies-gp-practices-and-appliance-contractors/dictionary-medicines-and-devices-dmd) - the DM+D has the names, descriptions and unique identifiers for medicines and devices that can be prescribed.\n    * [Business Servies Authority (BSA)](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/) - the BSA website has guidance and codes for endorsements and prescription types for reimbursement.\n    \n    ### Guidance for developers and product owners\n    Documentation and guidance about EPS for technical and non-technical audiences\n    * [Simplifier implementation guide for digital medicines](https://simplifier.net/guide/ukcoreimplementationguideformedicines?version=current) - the implementation guide contains detailed information and example messages, error codes and processes. This is for technical audiences like developers.\n    * [Building healhtcare software - prescriptions](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/building-healthcare-software/prescriptions) - this explains how to build software that deals with presriptions. This is for non-technical audiences like product owners.\n\n    ## API status and roadmap\n    The immediate priority of EPS development is to support the rollout of the next-gen FHIR APIs for primary care and secondary care prescribing and dispensing.\n    \n    ### Prescribing\n    The API supports prescribers in primary and secondary care settings. This means prescriptions are sent from a GP or NHS hospital to a pharmacy. For these workflows, the API is in [in production, beta](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses), meaning:\n    * it is available in integration and production\n    * we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give advance notice\n    \n    ### Dispensing\n    This API supports a community pharmacy dispensing workflow.\n\n    In a community pharmacy workflow, prescriptions can be released (downloaded) from EPS, updated, dispensed, and then claimed by the pharmacy. For this workflow, the API is in [in development](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses), meaning:\n    - it is available for testing in the integration environment, but not for production use\n    - we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give advance notice\n\n    ### Roadmap\n    To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?tag=eps-fhir-api).\n    \n    If you have any other queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).\n\n    ## Service level\n    This API is a platinum service, meaning it is operational and supported 24x7x365.\n\n    For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).\n\n    ## Technology\n    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).\n\n    It conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/), except that it does not support the [capabilities](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities) interaction.\n\n    It includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which are built against [FHIR UK Core, specifically [UKcore.stu1 0.5.1](https://simplifier.net/packages/fhir.r4.ukcore.stu1/0.5.1).\n    \n    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules. In particular:\n    * resource names are capitalised and singular, for example `/Patient` not `/patients`\n    * array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines\n    * data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object\n    \n    There are [libraries and software development kits available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.\n\n    ## Network access\n    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).\n    To use this API with [NHS smartcards](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers), the end user needs an HSCN connection, although internet-facing alternatives to smartcards are available.\n    \n    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).\n\n    ## Security and authorisation\n    This API has 2 access modes:\n    * user-restricted access\n    * application-restricted access\n    \n    ### User-restricted access\n    The EPS APIs are mostly [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis),\n    meaning we authenticate the end user.\n\n    EPS only supports [CIS2 separate authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-cis2-separate-authentication-and-authorisation),\n    do not use combined authentication and authorisation.\n \n    The only interaction that is not user-restricted is releasing nominated prescriptions.\n  \n    ### Application-restricted access\n    Use this access mode to release nominated prescriptions while dispensing. \n    \n    To use this access mode, use the following security pattern:\n    * [Application-restricted RESTful API - signed JWT authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication)\n\n    ## Environment and testing\n    | Environment       | Base URL                                                            |\n    | -------------     | --------------------------------------------------------------------|\n    | Sandbox           | `https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/electronic-prescriptions`       |\n    | Integration test  | `https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/electronic-prescriptions`           |\n    | Production        |  `https://api.service.nhs.uk/electronic-prescriptions`                                                 |\n\n    ### Sandbox testing\n    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):\n\n    * is for early developer testing\n    * only covers a limited set of scenarios\n    * is stateless, so it does not actually persist any updates\n    * is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation\n\n    For details of sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our \"Try this API\" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.\n\n    ### Integration testing\n    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):\n\n    * is for formal integration testing\n    * is stateful, so persists updates\n    * includes authorisation, with [smartcard](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers) and non-smartcard options\n\n    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).\n\n    ## Onboarding\n    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding.\n    The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.\n\n    To begin the onboarding process please download and complete the [EPS use case form](https://nhs-prod.global.ssl.fastly.net/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/developer/electronic-prescription-service-fhir-api/eps-access-form-v1.0-org-short-name-yyyymmdd-1.docx) and email it to us at [epsonboarding@nhs.net](mailto:epsonboarding@nhs.net).\n\n    ## Resources\n    Use the [Digital Medicines Implementation Guide](https://simplifier.net/guide/NHSDigital-Medicines) to assist with your integration.\n    This is the FHIR specification for Digital Medicines starting with the assets required for an electronic prescription sent to the EPS.\n    \n    For further guidance on prescribing, see [EPS prescribing developer guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/building-healthcare-software/prescriptions/eps-prescriber-developer-guide).\n\n    ## Errors\n    ### API wide errors\n    | HTTP Status   | Error Code             | Description                                                                      |\n    | --------------| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n    | 400           | BAD_REQUEST            | Invalid request.                                                                 |\n    | 400           | MISSING_FIELD          | A required field is missing within the request, see `display` field in response. |\n    | 400           | INVALID_VALUE          | Invalid value in message.                                                        |\n    | 400           | INCORRECT_RESOURCETYPE | FHIR resource has an incorrect resourceType.                                     |\n    | 404           | NOT_FOUND              | Resource not found.                                                              |\n\n    ### Platform wide errors\n    | HTTP Status   | Error Code            | Description                                                                                                                           |\n    | ------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n    | 401           | ACCESS_DENIED         | User does not have permission for a particular request.                                                                               |\n    | 403           | FORBIDDEN             | Insufficient authorization.                                                                                                           |\n    | 404           | NOT_FOUND             | Route not found.                                                                                                                      |\n    | 500           | INTERNAL SERVER ERROR | The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle.                                                                |\n    | 504           | GATEWAY_TIMEOUT       | If your request has not been fully processed within 59 seconds, you will get this response.
