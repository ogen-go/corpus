These can be\n      things like rebooting, resizing, snapshotting, etc.\n\n      Droplet action requests are generally targeted at one of the \"actions\"\n      endpoints for a specific Droplet. The specific actions are usually\n      initiated by sending a POST request with the action and arguments as\n      parameters.\n\n      Droplet action requests create a Droplet actions object, which can be used\n      to get information about the status of an action. Creating a Droplet\n      action is asynchronous: the HTTP call will return the action object before\n      the action has finished processing on the Droplet. The current status of\n      an action can be retrieved from either the Droplet actions endpoint or the\n      global actions endpoint. If a Droplet action is uncompleted it may block\n      the creation of a subsequent action for that Droplet, the locked attribute\n      of the Droplet will be true and attempts to create a Droplet action will\n      fail with a status of 422.\n\n  - name: Droplets\n    description: \u003e-\n      A [Droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/) is a DigitalOcean\n      virtual machine.

Currently,\n      there are five types of images: snapshots, backups, applications,\n      distributions, and custom images.\n\n      * [Snapshots](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/snapshots/) provide\n      a full copy of an existing Droplet instance taken on demand.\n\n      * [Backups](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/backups/) are similar\n      to snapshots but are created automatically at regular intervals when\n      enabled for a Droplet.\n\n      * [Custom images](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/custom-images/)\n      are Linux-based virtual machine images (raw, qcow2, vhdx, vdi, and vmdk\n      formats are supported) that you may upload for use on DigitalOcean.\n\n      * Distributions are the public Linux distributions that are available to\n      be used as a base to create Droplets.\n\n      * Applications, or [1-Click Apps](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/one-clicks/),\n      are distributions pre-configured with additional software.\n\n      To interact with images, you will generally send requests to the images\n      endpoint at /v2/images.\n\n  - name: Kubernetes\n    description: \u003e-\n      [DigitalOcean Kubernetes](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/kubernetes/)\n      allows you to quickly deploy scalable and secure Kubernetes clusters. By\n      sending requests to the `/v2/kubernetes/clusters` endpoint, you can list,\n      create, or delete clusters as well as scale node pools up and down,\n      recycle individual nodes, and retrieve the kubeconfig file for use with\n      a cluster.\n\n  - name: Load Balancers\n    description: \u003e-\n      [DigitalOcean Load Balancers](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/load-balancers/)\n      provide a way to distribute traffic across multiple Droplets. By sending\n      requests to the `/v2/load_balancers` endpoint, you can list, create, or\n      delete load balancers as well as add or remove Droplets, forwarding rules,\n      and other configuration details.\n\n  - name: Monitoring\n    description: \u003e-\n      The DigitalOcean Monitoring API makes it possible to programmatically retrieve metrics as well as configure alert\n      policies based on these metrics.

A\n      valid URN has the following format: `do:resource_type:resource_id`. The\n      following resource types are supported:\n\n      Resource Type      | Example URN\n      -------------------|------------\n      App Platform App   | `do:app:be5aab85-851b-4cab-b2ed-98d5a63ba4e8`\n      Database           | `do:dbaas:83c7a55f-0d84-4760-9245-aba076ec2fb2`\n      Domain             | `do:domain:example.com`\n      Droplet            | `do:droplet:4126873`\n      Floating IP        | `do:floatingip:192.168.99.100`\n      Kubernetes Cluster | `do:kubernetes:bd5f5959-5e1e-4205-a714-a914373942af`\n      Load Balancer      | `do:loadbalancer:39052d89-8dd4-4d49-8d5a-3c3b6b365b5b`\n      Space              | `do:space:my-website-assets`\n      Volume             | `do:volume:6fc4c277-ea5c-448a-93cd-dd496cfef71f`\n\n      ### Resource Status Codes\n\n      When assigning and retrieving resources in projects, a `status` attribute\n      is returned that indicates if a resource was successfully retrieved or\n      assigned. The status codes can be one of the following:\n\n      Status Code        | Explanation\n      -------------------|------------\n      `ok`               | There was no problem retrieving or assigning a resource.\n      `not_found`        | The resource was not found.\n      `assigned`         | The resource was successfully assigned.\n      `already_assigned` | The resource was already assigned.\n      `service_down`     | There was a problem retrieving or assigning a resource. Please try again.\n\n  - name: Projects\n    description: \u003e-\n      Projects allow you to organize your resources into groups that fit the way\n      you work. You can group resources (like Droplets, Spaces, load balancers,\n      domains, and floating IPs) in ways that align with the applications\n      you host on DigitalOcean.\n\n  - name: Regions\n    description: Provides information about DigitalOcean data center regions.\n\n  - name: Reserved IP Actions\n    description: |\n      As of 16 June 2022, we have renamed the [Floating IP](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/#tag/Floating-IPs) \n      product to Reserved IPs. The Reserved IP product's endpoints function the exact \n      same way as Floating IPs. The only difference is the name change throughout the \n      URLs and fields. For example, the `floating_ips` field is now the `reserved_ips` field. \n      The Floating IP endpoints will remain active until fall 2023 before being \n      permanently deprecated.\n\n      With the exception of the [Projects API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/#tag/Projects), \n      we will reflect this change as an additional field in the responses across the API \n      where the `floating_ip` field is used. For example, the Droplet metadata response \n      will contain the field `reserved_ips` in addition to the `floating_ips` field.\n      Floating IPs retrieved using the Projects API will retain the original name.\n\n      Reserved IP actions are commands that can be given to a DigitalOcean\n      reserved IP. These requests are made on the actions endpoint of a specific\n      reserved IP.\n\n      An action object is returned. These objects hold the current status of the\n      requested action.\n\n  - name: Reserved IPs\n    description: |\n      As of 16 June 2022, we have renamed the [Floating IP](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/#tag/Floating-IPs) \n      product to Reserved IPs. The Reserved IP product's endpoints function the exact \n      same way as Floating IPs. The only difference is the name change throughout the \n      URLs and fields. For example, the `floating_ips` field is now the `reserved_ips` field. \n      The Floating IP endpoints will remain active until fall 2023 before being \n      permanently deprecated.\n\n      With the exception of the [Projects API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/#tag/Projects), \n      we will reflect this change as an additional field in the responses across the API \n      where the `floating_ip` field is used. For example, the Droplet metadata response \n      will contain the field `reserved_ips` in addition to the `floating_ips` field.\n      Floating IPs retrieved using the Projects API will retain the original name.\n\n      DigitalOcean Reserved IPs are publicly-accessible static IP addresses that can be \n      mapped to one of your Droplets. They can be used to create highly available \n      setups or other configurations requiring movable addresses.\n\n      Reserved IPs are bound to a specific region.\n\n  - name: Sizes\n    description: \u003e-\n      The sizes objects represent different packages of hardware resources that\n      can be used for Droplets. When a Droplet is created, a size must be\n      selected so that the correct resources can be allocated.\n\n      Each size represents a plan that bundles together specific sets of\n      resources. This includes the amount of RAM, the number of virtual CPUs,\n      disk space, and transfer. The size object also includes the pricing\n      details and the regions that the size is available in.\n\n  - name: Snapshots\n    description: \u003e-\n      [Snapshots](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/snapshots/) are saved\n      instances of a Droplet or a block storage volume, which is reflected in\n      the `resource_type` attribute. In order to avoid problems with compressing\n      filesystems, each defines a `min_disk_size` attribute which is the minimum\n      size of the Droplet or volume disk when creating a new resource from the\n      saved snapshot.\n\n      To interact with snapshots, you will generally send requests to the\n      snapshots endpoint at `/v2/snapshots`.\n\n  - name: SSH Keys\n    description: Manage SSH keys available on your account.\n\n  - name: Tags\n    description: \u003e-\n      A tag is a label that can be applied to a resource (currently Droplets,\n      Images, Volumes, Volume Snapshots, and Database clusters) in order to\n      better organize or facilitate the lookups and actions on it.\n\n      Tags have two attributes: a user defined `name` attribute and an embedded\n      `resources` attribute with information about resources that have been tagged.\n\n  - name: VPCs\n    description: \u003e-\n      [VPCs (virtual private clouds)](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/vpc/)\n      allow you to create virtual networks containing resources that can\n      communicate with each other in full isolation using private IP addresses.\n\n      By sending requests to the `/v2/vpcs` endpoint, you can create, configure,\n      list, and delete custom VPCs as well as retrieve information about the\n      resources assigned to them.\n\npaths:\n  /v2/1-clicks:\n    get:\n      $ref: 'resources/1-clicks/oneClicks_list.yml'\n\n  /v2/1-clicks/kubernetes:\n    post:\n      $ref:

    scheme: bearer\n      description: |\n        ## OAuth Authentication\n\n        In order to interact with the DigitalOcean API, you or your application must\n        authenticate.\n\n        The DigitalOcean API handles this through OAuth, an open standard for\n        authorization. OAuth allows you to delegate access to your account in full\n        or in read-only mode.\n\n        You can generate an OAuth token by visiting the [Apps \u0026 API](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/api/tokens)\n        section of the DigitalOcean control panel for your account.\n\n        An OAuth token functions as a complete authentication request. In effect, it\n        acts as a substitute for a username and password pair.\n\n        Because of this, it is absolutely **essential** that you keep your OAuth\n        tokens secure. In fact, upon generation, the web interface will only display\n        each token a single time in order to prevent the token from being compromised.\n\n        DigitalOcean access tokens begin with an identifiable prefix in order to\n        distinguish them from other similar tokens.\n\n        - `dop_v1_` for personal access tokens generated in the control panel\n        - `doo_v1_` for tokens generated by applications using [the OAuth flow](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/oauth-api/)\n        - `dor_v1_` for OAuth refresh tokens\n\n        ### How to Authenticate with OAuth\n\n        In order to make an authenticated request, include a bearer-type\n        `Authorization` header containing your OAuth token. All requests must be\n        made over HTTPS.\n\n        ### Authenticate with a Bearer Authorization Header\n\n        ```\n        curl -X $HTTP_METHOD -H \"Authorization: Bearer $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN\" \"https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/$OBJECT\"\n        ```\n\nsecurity:\n  - bearer_auth: []\n",
