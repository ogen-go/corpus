If both `area` and `any` are specified, then `area` is ignored.\n\n        By default, cell based positioning returns cell tower level location estimates only. If you allow a WGS-84 compliant geocoordinate location estimate based on LAC, RNC, TAC, NID, or RZ areas, use the `fallback=area` setting. If you use the `fallback=any` setting, the service uses all available cell fallback methods and therefore the location estimate in the response may be at the MNC, SID, or MCC level.\n\n        For privacy reasons, the precise positioning based on a single WLAN AP is not possible. You can use the `fallback=singleWifi` setting to allow less accurate positioning based on a single WLAN AP. In that case, the center location of the position estimate will be deviated and the reported accuracy radius will be larger.\n      explode: false\n      in: query\n      name: fallback\n      required: false\n      schema:\n        items:\n          enum:\n            - any\n            - area\n            - singleWifi\n          type: string\n        type: array\n      style: form\n    RequestID:\n      description: |\n        ID used for correlating customer requests within HERE services.
