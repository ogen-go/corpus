They are used to consume\n      services from an IXP.\n\n      Accounts can have a hierarchy, i.e. an\n      account can have sub-accounts. The max-depth of\n      the account-hierarchy may vary by implementer, but it's safe to\n      assume an account can have sub-accounts.\n\n      Each `Account` has a state. Only `Account`s in state `production`\n      or `production_state_pending` are ready to consume services.\n\n      There are `Contact`s associated with each account. Contacts can\n      be assigned for `Role`s via `RoleAssignment`s. Depending on the\n      IXP and the services the account wants to use, contacts with\n      specific roles may be required.\n      A contact with role `legal` is mandatory for an account to become\n      operational.\n\n      Only accounts with `billing_information` present can be used\n      as a `billing_account`.\n    name: accounts\n  - description: |-\n      Open an authorized session with the IX-API. This is equivalent to\n      a 'login' endpoint.\n\n      Upon success, you will receive an `access_token` and\n      a `refreh_token`. Both are JWTs and have limited lifetimes. You\n      can get information like their expiry time directly by parsing\n      the tokens.\n\n      Use the `access_token` as `Bearer` in your `Authorization` header\n      for getting access to the API.\n\n      When the session (i.e. the `access_token`) expires, use the\n      `refresh_token` (if it's not yet expired) with the\n      `refresh`-endpoint to reauthenticate and get a fresh `access_token`.\n    name: auth\n  -
