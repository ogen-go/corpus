If you are have a valid auth cookie then no additional auth-related actions are taken. If you are **not** logged in then it will log you in with the `Authorization` header and set the `auth` cookie. The `auth` cookie will only be sent once.\n          2) If logged in, this function will also return the CurrentUser object containing detailed information about the currently logged in user.\n\n        **WARNING: Session Limit:** Each authentication with login credentials counts as a separate session, out of which you have a limited amount. Make sure to save and reuse the `auth` cookie if you are often restarting the program. The provided API libraries automatically save cookies during runtime, but does not persist during restart. While it can be fine to use username/password during development, expect in production to very fast run into the rate-limit and be temporarily blocked from making new sessions until older ones expire. The exact number of simultaneous sessions is unknown/undisclosed.\n      parameters: []\n      security:\n        - authHeader: []\n        - authHeader: []\n          twoFactorAuthCookie: []\n        - authCookie: []\n  /auth/exists:\n    get:\n      summary: Check User Exists\n      tags:\n        - authentication\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          $ref: ../responses/authentication/UserExistsResponse.yaml\n        '400':\n          $ref: ../responses/authentication/MissingParameterError.yaml\n      operationId: checkUserExists\n      parameters:\n        - $ref: ../parameters.yaml#/email\n        - $ref: ../parameters.yaml#/displayName\n        - $ref: ../parameters.yaml#/userIdQuery\n        - $ref: ../parameters.yaml#/excludeUserId\n      description: |-\n        Checks if a user by a given `username`, `displayName` or `email` exist.

In the later two cases the `excludeUserId` is used to exclude oneself, otherwise the result would always be true.\n\n        It is **REQUIRED** to include **AT LEAST** `username`, `displayName` **or** `email` query parameter. Although they can be combined - in addition with `excludeUserId` (generally to exclude yourself) - to further fine-tune the search.\n      security:\n        - apiKeyCookie: []\n  /auth/twofactorauth/totp/verify:\n    post:\n      summary: Verify 2FA code\n      operationId: verify2FA\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          $ref: ../responses/authentication/Verify2FAResponse.yaml\n        '401':\n          $ref: ../responses/MissingCredentialsError.yaml\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: ../requests/TwoFactorAuthCode.yaml\n            examples: {}\n      description: Finishes the login sequence with a normal 2FA-generated code for accounts with 2FA-protection enabled.\n      tags:\n        - authentication\n      security:\n        - authCookie: []\n      parameters: []\n  /auth/twofactorauth/otp/verify:\n    post:\n      summary: Verify 2FA code with Recovery code\n      operationId: verifyRecoveryCode\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          $ref: ../responses/authentication/Verify2FAResponse.yaml\n        '401':\n          $ref: ../responses/MissingCredentialsError.yaml\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: ../requests/TwoFactorAuthCode.yaml\n            examples: {}\n      description: Finishes the login sequence with an OTP (One Time Password) recovery code for accounts with 2FA-protection enabled.\n      tags:\n        - authentication\n      security:\n        - authCookie: []\n  '/user/{userId}/delete':\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: ../parameters.yaml#/userId\n    put:\n      summary: Delete User\n      operationId: deleteUser\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          $ref: ../responses/authentication/DeleteUserResponse.yaml\n        '401':\n          $ref: ../responses/MissingCredentialsError.yaml\n      tags:\n        - authentication\n      description: |-\n        Deletes the account with given ID.
