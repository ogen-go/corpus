In British English a campsite is an area, usually divided\n        into a number of pitches, where people can camp overnight using tents or\n        camper vans or caravans; this British English use of the word is synonymous\n        with the American English expression campground. In American English the\n        term campsite generally means an area where an individual, family, group, or\n        military unit can pitch a tent or parks a camper; a campground may contain\n        many campsites (Source: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, see <a\n        href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campsite\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campsite</a>).\n    \n        <br /><br />\n    \n        See also the <a href=\"/docs/hotels.html\">dedicated document on the use of\n        schema.org for marking up hotels and other forms of accommodations</a>.\n    CampingPitch:\n      $ref: '#/components/schemas/Accommodation'\n      description: >-\n        A camping pitch is an individual place for overnight stay in the outdoors,\n        typically being part of a larger camping site.\n    \n        <br /><br />\n    \n        See also the <a href=\"/docs/hotels.html\">dedicated document on the use of\n        schema.org for marking up hotels and other forms of accommodations</a>.\n    Canal:\n      $ref: '#/components/schemas/BodyOfWater'\n      description: 'A canal, like the Panama Canal.'\n    CancelAction:\n      $ref: '#/components/schemas/PlanAction'\n      description: >\n        The act of asserting that a future event/action is no longer going to\n        happen.<br/><br/>\n    \n    \n        Related actions:<br/><br/>\n    \n    \n        <ul>\n    \n        <li><a class=\"localLink\"\n        href=\"http://schema.org/ConfirmAction\">ConfirmAction</a>: The antonym of\n        CancelAction.</li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    Car:\n      allOf:\n        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Vehicle'\n        - properties:\n            acrissCode:\n              description: >-\n                The ACRISS Car Classification Code is a code used by many car rental\n                companies, for classifying vehicles.

The simplest use of\n                <em>speakable</em> has (potentially relative) URL values,\n                referencing identified sections of the document concerned.<br/><br/>\n    \n    \n                2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via\n                class attribute. Use the <a class=\"localLink\"\n                href=\"http://schema.org/cssSelector\">cssSelector</a>\n                property.<br/><br/>\n    \n    \n                3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of\n                the content). Use the <a class=\"localLink\"\n                href=\"http://schema.org/xpath\">xpath</a> property.<br/><br/>\n    \n    \n                For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID\n                references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out\n                document section(s) as speakable.
