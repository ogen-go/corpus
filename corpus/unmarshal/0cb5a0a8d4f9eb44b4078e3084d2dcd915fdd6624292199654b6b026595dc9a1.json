It\n      also provides an easy access to\n\n      its size, mime-type, user-defined tags and description thus allowing easy\n      sorting and searching among stored\n\n      files.\n\n      There are several methods of file uploading available: multipart/form-data\n      encoded form, RAW POST (by sending\n\n      file contents as POST body), fetching from URL (by providing the file URL\n      via 'url' param)\n\n      Attachment is an entity that is used to link a File to one or multiple\n      objects like Customer, Dispute, Payment,\n\n      Transaction, Order, Plan, Product, Invoice, Note. That allows to\n      quickly find and use files related to\n\n      those specific entities.\n  - name: Invoices\n    description: \u003e\n      Invoices leave a record for both you and your customer of the products\n      sold.\n  - name: Payment Instruments\n    description: \u003e\n      The Payment Instrument allows you to accept a variety of payment methods through a single API.\n  - name: Payment Tokens\n    description: \u003e\n      Payment tokens are used to reduce the scope of PCI DSS compliance.  A\n      payment\n\n      token can be made using a different authentication scheme (refer to the\n      public key\n\n      authentication scheme in the Authentication section), which allows you to\n\n      create a payment token directly from the browser, bypassing the need to\n      send\n\n      sensitive cardholder info to your servers.  We recommend using this with\n      our\n\n      Rebilly.js library, which helps you wire a form into this API resource and\n      create\n\n      payment tokens.\n  - name: Products\n    description: |\n      A product describes what you sell (goods or services).\n      A product determines how what you sell appears on invoices and receipts.\n      The pricing for products is set in Plans.  One product can have many\n      plans.\n  - name: Plans\n    description: \u003e\n      Plans are a template for making a subscription.  For example, you may have\n      a plan\n\n      that has a 30-day free trial followed by a recurring charge of $19.95 per\n      month\n\n      until canceled.  The combination of the plan and a request to make an\n      order\n\n      will apply those instructions to create the invoices according to the\n      plan's\n\n      schedule.\n  - name: Search\n    description: |\n      Search data including customers, invoices, orders, transactions and more.\n  - name: Shipping rates\n    description: \u003e\n      A shipping rate contains a filter and a pricing for a specific shipping destination.\n  - name: Orders\n    description: \u003e\n      An order applies a plan's template to create invoice(s) for a customer,\n      optionally at the appropriate scheduled intervals.\n      A subscription order may also determine if the payment\n      is collected automatically (with autopay set true).\n  - name: Tags\n    description: |\n      Tag customers to better organize your data.\n  - name: Transactions\n    description: |\n      Get and refund transactions.\n  - name: Fees\n    description: |\n      Buy and sell fees.\n\n      This API is experimental and not guaranteed to be backward compatible.\n  - name: API Keys\n    description: |\n      Always keep your API Keys private. When creating your API keys,\n      you can restrict them to a given set of permissions.\n      In addition to your API Keys, you may use\n      JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate to the API.

You can have multiple organizations.\n\n      Note: Organizations are shared between \"Live\" and \"Sandbox\" environments.\n  - name: Profile\n    description: |\n      A Profile represents the person currently logged in to Rebilly.\n  - name: Reset password\n    description: |\n      When a password reset is requested, an email with a token is sent. Upon receiving the email\n      the user then needs to click a link and choose a new password.\n  - name: Rules\n    description: |\n      \"Don't conform to the rules. Create the rules.\"\n      Rather than adapt your workflow and business, Rebilly can align with your business\n      objectives by giving you the power to automate certain behaviors when key events happen.\n      You can use this to your advantage to mitigate risk, maximize conversions and minimize costs.\n      You have the controls at your fingertips here. If you need more control,\n      or help dialing in on a strategy, feel free to contact us.\n\n      When an event happens, it triggers the evaluation of conditions (that you set up),\n      in order from top to bottom. If the condition is met, the corresponding actions are executed.\n      The conditions continue to be checked until either all of the conditions have been executed,\n      or a special \"stop\" action is executed.\n  - name: JWT Session\n    description: |\n      A session contains a token, which is a JSON Web Token.  The token is created\n      with a user's signin credentials.\n\n      This token can be used to authenticate to the API.  In addition, the session can be set to\n      expire at a particular time. Use the token to then authenticate for further requests to the Rebilly API.\n\n      The token should be kept private, but could be stored on the user's browser\n      client to simulate a \"session\".\n  - name: Status\n    description: |\n      Check the status of the Rebilly API (no authentication required).\n  - name: Tracking\n    description: |\n      Tracking is a layer for accessing all the activity (API requests,\n      subscriptions, webhooks, events, etc.), thus providing easier\n      debugging and issues auditing.\n  - name: Users\n    description: |\n      A User represents a person who can login to Rebilly, and take actions subject to\n      their granted permissions.\n  - name: Websites\n    description: |\n      A Website represents the website/brand that customers interact with... You\n      could think of it like a brand.  For example, Nestle owns Perrier and Purina\n      and PowerBar.\n\n      We recognize that some enterprises have more than one website (or brand).  The\n      website is related to each invoice and each payment gateway account.  This feature\n      would allow you to have gateway accounts that are related to multiple websites, or\n      exclusive to particular websites.  And gives you more control over your business.\n  - name: Webhook Credentials\n    description: |\n      Get and create Webhook credential hashes.\n  - name: Webhooks\n    description: |\n      Webhooks are designed to notify your systems when certain/all registered events happen in near real-time.\n      They allow you to collect information about those events. Rebilly can send these information via\n      POST to an URL of your choice.\n  - name: Segments\n    description: |\n      Segments are grid UI settings that can be shared with other users. They are like a custom view.\n      For example, one may set up a transaction grid to show specific columns and sort a certain way, and share it with\n      others in their organization.\n  - name: Memberships\n    description: |\n      Membership describe the relationships between organizations and users.\n      For example, one user could have more than one organization.\n  - name: Roles\n    description: |\n      Roles are an implementation of the general hierarchical RBAC.
