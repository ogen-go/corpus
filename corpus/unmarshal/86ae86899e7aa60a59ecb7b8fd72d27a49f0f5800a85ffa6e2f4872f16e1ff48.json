Read through the getting \n    started section before you dive in. Most of your problems should be solved \n    just by reading through it.\n\n    ## Getting Started\n\n    Let's make our first API request to the D&D 5th Edition API!\n\n    Open up a terminal and use [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) or [httpie](http://httpie.org/) \n    to make an API request for a resource. You can also scroll through the\n    definitions below and send requests directly from the endpoint documentation!\n\n    For example, if you paste and run this `curl` command:\n    ```bash\n    curl -X GET \"https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/ability-scores/cha\" -H \"Accept: application/json\"\n    ```\n\n    We should see a result containing details about the Charisma ability score:\n    ```bash\n    {\n      \"index\": \"cha\",\n      \"name\": \"CHA\",\n      \"full_name\": \"Charisma\",\n      \"desc\": [\n        \"Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It \n          includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent \n          a charming or commanding personality.\",\n        \"A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain \n          others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, \n          or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, \n          Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in \n          certain kinds of Charisma checks.\"\n      ],\n      \"skills\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Deception\",\n          \"index\": \"deception\",\n          \"url\": \"/api/skills/deception\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Intimidation\",\n          \"index\": \"intimidation\",\n          \"url\": \"/api/skills/intimidation\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Performance\",\n          \"index\": \"performance\",\n          \"url\": \"/api/skills/performance\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Persuasion\",\n          \"index\": \"persuasion\",\n          \"url\": \"/api/skills/persuasion\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"url\": \"/api/ability-scores/cha\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Authentication \n\n    The dnd5eapi is a completely open API. No authentication is required to query \n    and get data. This also means that we've limited what you can do to just \n    `GET`-ing the data. If you find a mistake in the data, feel free to \n    [message us](https://discord.gg/TQuYTv7).\n\n    ## GraphQL\n\n    This API supports [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). The GraphQL URL for this API\n    is `https://www.dnd5eapi.co/graphql`. GraphQL functionality is not covered in \n    this documentation.\n\n    ## Schemas\n\n    Definitions of all schemas will be accessible in a future update. Two of the most common schemas are described here.\n\n    ### `APIReference`\n    Represents a minimal representation of a resource. The detailed representation of the referenced resource can be retrieved by making a request to the referenced `URL`.\n    ```\n    APIReference {\n      index     string    \n      name      string    \n      url       string   \n    }\n    ```\n    <hr>\n\n    ### `Choice`\n    Represents a choice made by a player. Commonly seen related to decisions made during character creation or combat (e.g.: the description of the cleric class, under **Proficiencies**, states \"Skills: Choose two from\tHistory, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and\tReligion\" [[SRD p15]](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf#page=15))\n    ```\n    Choice {\n      choose    number            \n      type      string            \n      from      [APIReference]   \n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## FAQ\n\n    ### What is the SRD?\n    The SRD, or Systems Reference Document, contains guidelines for publishing content under the OGL. This allows for some of the data for D&D 5e to be open source. The API only covers data that can be found in the SRD. [Here's a link to the full text of the SRD.](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf)\n\n    ### What is the OGL?\n    The Open Game License (OGL) is a public copyright license by Wizards of the Coast that may be used by tabletop role-playing game developers to grant permission to modify, copy, and redistribute some of the content designed for their games, notably game mechanics. However, they must share-alike copies and derivative works. [More information about the OGL can be found here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Game_License)\n\n    ### A monster, spell, subclass, etc. is missing from the API / Database. Can I add it?\n    Please check if the data is within the SRD. If it is, feel free to open an issue or PR to add it yourself. Otherwise, due to legal reasons, we cannot add it.\n\n    ### Can this API be self hosted?\n    Yes it can! You can also host the data yourself if you don't want to use the API at all. You can also make changes and add extra data if you like. However, it is up to you to merge in new changes to the data and API. \n\n    #### Can I publish is on <insert platform>? Is this free use?\n    Yes, you can. The API itself is under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), and the underlying data accessible via the API is supported under the SRD and OGL.\n\n    # Status Page\n\n    The status page for the API can be found here: https://5e-bits.github.io/dnd-uptime/\n\n    # Chat \n\n    Come hang out with us [on Discord](https://discord.gg/TQuYTv7)!\n\n    # Contribute\n\n    This API is built from two repositories.\n      - The repo containing the data lives here: https://github.com/bagelbits/5e-database\n      - The repo with the API implementation lives here: https://github.com/bagelbits/5e-srd-api \n\n    This is a evolving API and having fresh ideas are always welcome! You can \n    open an issue in either repo, open a PR for changes, or just discuss with \n    other users in this discord.\n\n    # Legacy Documentation\n\n    This documentation page is new!
