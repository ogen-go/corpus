Studies have found that suicide rates increase by 0.7 percent in the United States when there is 1 degree Celsius of warming. Given the warming trends from our continued emissions of heat-trapping gases, Stanford researchers found “up to 21,000 additional suicides will occur by 2050 within the United States and Mexico” if significant action is not taken.

The Integrated Benefits Institute found that “for every 1,000 US employees, mood disorders in the workforce cost about $232,000 in excess health care treatments and lost work time”. Notably, availability of air conditioners does not prevent the impacts of heat on suicide. In addition to increased funding for suicide prevention, hospitals and other organizations can work to disseminate information on building individual resiliency behaviors.

For example, lower water reserves and agricultural yields result from a warming planet, forcing people to choose between migration or competition for resources. A study published in Nature estimates “climate has influenced between 3% and 20% of armed conflict risk over the last century”. And David Wallace-Wells claims, “for every half of a degree of warming, societies will see between 10 and 20 increase in the likelihood of armed conflict”. Other researchers, such as Solomon Hsiang and Marshall Burke, have tried to quantify the relationship between climate change and conflict, finding that “each rise in temperature or extreme rainfall by one standard variation increased the frequency of interpersonal violence by 4% and intergroup conflict by 14%.”\\n\\nThe Pentagon has even recognized the severity of this issue, warning Congress that it poses a national security issue. According to their staff it is a “threat multiplier” because climate change exacerbates the amount of violence surrounding existing threats such as hunger, poverty, and war. People's temperaments are more prone to be anxious and hostile at higher temperatures, where it becomes more difficult to make rational decisions. This is why increased temperatures are the leading cause of conflict in human interaction. As David-Wallace wells notes in his book, \\\"Heat frays everything. It increases violent crime rates, swearing on social media, and the likelihood that a major-league pitcher, coming to the mound after his teammate has been hit by a pitch, will hit an opposing batter in retaliation. The hotter it gets, the longer drivers will honk their horns in frustration; and even in simulations, police officers are more likely to fire on intruders when the exercises are conducted in hotter weather. By 2099, one speculative paper tabulated climate change in the US would bring about an additional 22,000 murders, 180,000 rapes, 3.5 million assaults, and 3.76 million robberies, burglaries, and acts of larceny.\\\" \\n\\nMigration is another outcome from climate disruption that can lead to violence. The World Bank estimates if we continue burning fossil fuels unabated there could be as many as 200 million climate migrants by 2050, seeking new areas to live when their home can no longer support their family from impacts such as sea level rise, extreme heat, fires, or drought. This means one out of every 45 people would be displaced by climate change. And studies have shown humanitarian crises such as forced migration, lead to an increase in violence against women. At the same time, protection against violence diminishes. With actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, these vast migrations can be avoided by up to 80% according to the World Bank. To keep people safe, we must move society away from burning fossil fuels to avoid catastrophic climate change that increases physical violence globally.\"\r\n                  effectId: RDavliTi6W93xwahwtUnUtG\r\n                  effectScore: 18.05\r\n                  effectShortDescription: The continued rise in frequency of warm days and nights, in addition to heatwaves, is driving increases in physical violence.\r\n                  effectSolutions:\r\n                  - imageUrl: null\r\n                    iri: R8ECf0I0zdW2MwEbGGbcBdK\r\n                    longDescription: Engaging with your local elected representatives about supporting climate-friendly policy is a great way to positively affect climate change.

Today, some 6.2 million Americans under the age of 18 suffer from asthma. Asthma is made worse by climate change in at least 3 ways: pollen, wildfire smoke, and ozone pollution.\\n\\nThe increase in carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels encourages faster plant growth, which has caused pollen levels to more than double since 1900. Pollen is expected to quadruple by 2060 compared to 1900 if society continues burning fossil fuels. The rate of asthma — which often occurs alongside pollen allergies — nearly tripled between 1980 and 2010. And researchers have found that global warming is also causing the pollen season to extend longer. The pollen season is now longer by two weeks on average across the U.S., and by at least four weeks in 34 cities. The largest changes have occurred in the West, with increases of two months or more in Bend, Oregon; Medford, Oregon; and Las Cruces, New Mexico. This means that plants that produce pollen, such as ragweed, certain kinds of grass, and trees are able to release more pollen for longer periods of time each year. This is resulting in frequent asthma attacks in people whose asthma are triggered by allergies.\\n\\nWe are also witnessing more frequent and intense wildfires due to climate change. Wildfires produce smoke that contains particulate matter. The fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with development of asthma, especially in children and is also one of the causes of other respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. \\n\\nLastly, hotter temperatures especially in urban areas is resulting in increased ground level ozone pollution. Ozone is typically associated with decreased lung functions, respiratory conditions like chronic pulmonary disease (COPD) and can trigger asthma attacks. \\n\\nFor all these reasons, climate change is a health emergency that demands immediate action globally to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible.\"\r\n                  effectId: RO1J1OifvuO602qTIrSXdB\r\n                  effectScore: 15.16\r\n                  effectShortDescription: Ground level ozone pollution, longer pollen seasons and persistent wildfires are resulting in frequent asthma attacks and complications, especially among children.\r\n                  effectSolutions:\r\n                  - imageUrl: null\r\n                    iri: RDsBA6sw2PNZOr6WuF0MvpQ\r\n                    longDescription: Degraded lands present potential locations for tree plantations.

The second is called “direct air capture” which pulls out carbon dioxide that is already in the air. Once this carbon is captured, it can be stored underground or converted into a carbon-containing product. \\n\\nCarbon capture is seen as a vital part of the transition to a carbon neutral economy.

The International Energy Agency expects carbon capture to reach 2,300 megatonnes per year by 2040, which correlates to a seven percent reduction in global emissions. Policies can be implemented which help bring these technologies to market, such as setting higher carbon prices for existing emissions compared to those not in the air yet.

This means when it rains it can release more water than previously possible. Hurricanes become worse because not only can their clouds hold more water than before, warmer oceans allow hurricanes to become even larger with stronger wind speeds, and enables them to sit on top of cities for longer periods of time. Additionally, climate change is making our usual weather cycles more unusual and unpredictable, meaning that both dry seasons and wet seasons will be intensified. Additionally, sea level rise driven by melting ice caps is flooding coastal areas. All of these mean that once in a lifetime events like droughts, hurricanes, and floods are becoming increasingly common events, and will overwhelm our existing infrastructure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Flooding destroys both lives and property, ruins entire crops, and causes sewage and farm runoff to contaminate living areas and water supplies.

That’s actually faster than in areas outside of flood zones, where the population increased 13 percent. The United States is spending billions every year to move people into flood-prone areas and keep people living in flood-prone areas.

The National Flood Insurance Program paid $2.9 billion per year to citizens for flood-related losses between 2007 and 2017. These costs will only rise as climate change gets more extreme. Climate scientists have estimated that by 2100 somewhere between 17 and 210 trillion dollars worth of assets will be at flood risk due to rising sea levels, requiring massive investments in flood protection to mitigate disasters annually.

There is also evidence that air pollutants make blood inside blood vessels more likely to clot, causing strokes when those clots are dislodged, caught in the brain, and then block blood flow to the brain.

In a ranked choice system, voters rank all of the listed candidates from first to last instead of placing a single vote for one candidate. This allows voters to express their full range of support and incentivizes candidates to focus on creating strong platforms to address these issues to appeal to more voters. Ranked choice voting is gaining momentum across the country.

As of 2020, the CDC reports that there are approximately 805,000 heart attacks in the US every year. In 2014 and 2015, heart disease was found to cost the US $219 billion annually. Approximately half of the US population is exposed to one of the top risk factors for heart disease. These factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking.

This puts people at higher risk for heart attacks. With so many factors already influencing heart disease, shifting away from burning fossil fuels is necessary for protecting our health.

Framing your conversation around fairness and equality can help resolve perceived tensions between economic security and climate action. By explaining potential transitionary policies, such as government funding for retraining, we can alleviate the perceived conflict between economic security and climate action.

This threat is compounded by increasing human development in fire-prone areas such as forest and chaparral habitats. Policies designed to prevent wildfires such as prescribed burns, which remove fuel from the landscape, can help mitigate this threat, as can individual actions including creating defensible space around homes and buildings.

The government then sells or issues permits (also known as allowances) to the emitters of greenhouse gases. Every emitter is required to have permits for each ton of GHGs they release into the atmosphere. If an emitter exceeds their allotted GHG amount, they can trade to buy more permits from the state or from businesses who have additional permits and are willing to sell them. \\n\\nOver time, the government lowers the number of available permits each year, thereby creating a scarcity which in turn increases the cost.  The increased cost every year forces the emitters to look either for cleaner alternatives or to reduce their emissions in other ways. This is how cap-and-trade programs lower the total amount of carbon emissions over time.\\n\\nAn example is  California’s cap-and-trade program, where GHG emissions have substantially reduced by over 13% since 2006.

This rapid adoption is based in part on the historic growth rate of organic agriculture, as well as the projected conversion of conservation agriculture to regenerative annual cropping over time. This increase could result in a total reduction of 14.5-22.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide, from both sequestration and reduced emissions. Regenerative annual cropping could provide a $2.3-3.5 trillion lifetime operational cost savings and lifetime net profit gain of $135-206 billion on an investment of $79-116 billion.\r\n                    shortDescription: Building on conservation agriculture, regenerative annual cropping can include compost application, green manure and organic production.

Half the world's reef systems have already been destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Coral reefs have the highest biodiversity of all marine ecosystems on the planet. They are important habitats for many fish species. Many people also highly value coral reefs for their beauty.  Corals come in a rich array of colours and shapes, and shelter a wide range of marine life from sea turtles to brightly-coloured clownfish and angelfish. Parrotfish graze on the reefs themselves, producing the fine white sand characteristic of tropical beaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Reefs are also valuable fishery grounds and tourist destinations.

So as well as being of high intrinsic value, the loss of coral reefs threatens economies and leads to property damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Under climate change, marine heatwaves have doubled since 1982. If CO2 emissions aren't reduced, in the future these heatwaves will occur 50 times more often than they do today.

We have had ice ages and warmer periods when alligators were found in Spitzbergen. Ice ages have occurred in a hundred thousand year cycle for the last 700 thousand years, and there have been previous periods that appear to have been warmer than the present despite CO2 levels being lower than they are now. More recently, we have had the medieval warm period and the little ice age. (from Richard Lindzen)\r\n                  mythRebuttal: Greenhouse gases, principally CO2, have controlled most ancient climate changes. This time around humans are the cause, mainly by our CO2 emissions.\r\n                  mythSources:\r\n                  - https://skepticalscience.com/climate-change-little-ice-age-medieval-warm-period.htm\r\n                  mythTitle: Climate has changed before\r\n                  mythVideos:\r\n                  -

If yearly CO2 emissions aren't reduced, in the future these heatwaves will occur 50 times more often than they do today, causing over 97% of all coral reefs to die off along with much of the coastal marine life they support.

Project Drawdown assumes that as regenerative annual cropping becomes more widely used, farms that have already adopted conservation agriculture will convert to these more effective soil fertility practices in response to consumer demand for fewer harmful herbicides. The benefits of that conversion are counted by the regenerative annual cropping solution. Nonetheless, conservation agriculture offers significant benefits in the interim, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 13.4-9.4 gigatons based on average carbon sequestration rates of 0.25- 0.78 tons of carbon per hectare per year, depending on region.

For example, lower water reserves and agricultural yields result from a warming planet, forcing people to choose between migration or competition for resources. A study published in Nature estimates “climate has influenced between 3% and 20% of armed conflict risk over the last century”. And David Wallace-Wells claims, “for every half of a degree of warming, societies will see between 10 and 20 increase in the likelihood of armed conflict”. Other researchers, such as Solomon Hsiang and Marshall Burke, have tried to quantify the relationship between climate change and conflict, finding that “each rise in temperature or extreme rainfall by one standard variation increased the frequency of interpersonal violence by 4% and intergroup conflict by 14%.”\\n\\nThe Pentagon has even recognized the severity of this issue, warning Congress that it poses a national security issue. According to their staff it is a “threat multiplier” because climate change exacerbates the amount of violence surrounding existing threats such as hunger, poverty, and war. People's temperaments are more prone to be anxious and hostile at higher temperatures, where it becomes more difficult to make rational decisions. This is why increased temperatures are the leading cause of conflict in human interaction. As David-Wallace wells notes in his book, \\\"Heat frays everything. It increases violent crime rates, swearing on social media, and the likelihood that a major-league pitcher, coming to the mound after his teammate has been hit by a pitch, will hit an opposing batter in retaliation. The hotter it gets, the longer drivers will honk their horns in frustration; and even in simulations, police officers are more likely to fire on intruders when the exercises are conducted in hotter weather. By 2099, one speculative paper tabulated climate change in the US would bring about an additional 22,000 murders, 180,000 rapes, 3.5 million assaults, and 3.76 million robberies, burglaries, and acts of larceny.\\\" \\n\\nMigration is another outcome from climate disruption that can lead to violence. The World Bank estimates if we continue burning fossil fuels unabated there could be as many as 200 million climate migrants by 2050, seeking new areas to live when their home can no longer support their family from impacts such as sea level rise, extreme heat, fires, or drought. This means one out of every 45 people would be displaced by climate change. And studies have shown humanitarian crises such as forced migration, lead to an increase in violence against women. At the same time, protection against violence diminishes. With actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, these vast migrations can be avoided by up to 80% according to the World Bank. To keep people safe, we must move society away from burning fossil fuels to avoid catastrophic climate change that increases physical violence globally.\"\r\n          effectId: RDavliTi6W93xwahwtUnUtG\r\n          effectScore: 18.05\r\n          effectShortDescription: The continued rise in frequency of warm days and nights, in addition to heatwaves, is driving increases in physical violence.\r\n          effectSolutions:\r\n          - imageUrl: null\r\n            iri: R8ECf0I0zdW2MwEbGGbcBdK\r\n            longDescription: Engaging with your local elected representatives about supporting climate-friendly policy is a great way to positively affect climate change.

Pollen is expected to quadruple by 2060 compared to 1900 if society continues burning fossil fuels. The rate of asthma — which often occurs alongside pollen allergies — nearly tripled between 1980 and 2010. And researchers have found that global warming is also causing the pollen season to extend longer. The pollen season is now longer by two weeks on average across the U.S., and by at least four weeks in 34 cities. The largest changes have occurred in the West, with increases of two months or more in Bend, Oregon; Medford, Oregon; and Las Cruces, New Mexico. This means that plants that produce pollen, such as ragweed, certain kinds of grass, and trees are able to release more pollen for longer periods of time each year. This is resulting in frequent asthma attacks in people whose asthma are triggered by allergies.\\n\\nWe are also witnessing more frequent and intense wildfires due to climate change. Wildfires produce smoke that contains particulate matter. The fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with development of asthma, especially in children and is also one of the causes of other respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. \\n\\nLastly, hotter temperatures especially in urban areas is resulting in increased ground level ozone pollution. Ozone is typically associated with decreased lung functions, respiratory conditions like chronic pulmonary disease (COPD) and can trigger asthma attacks. \\n\\nFor all these reasons, climate change is a health emergency that demands immediate action globally to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible.\"\r\n          effectId: RO1J1OifvuO602qTIrSXdB\r\n          effectScore: 15.16\r\n          effectShortDescription: Ground level ozone pollution, longer pollen seasons and persistent wildfires are resulting in frequent asthma attacks and complications, especially among children.\r\n          effectSolutions:\r\n          - imageUrl: null\r\n            iri: RDsBA6sw2PNZOr6WuF0MvpQ\r\n            longDescription: Degraded lands present potential locations for tree plantations.

The second is called “direct air capture” which pulls out carbon dioxide that is already in the air.

This means when it rains it can release more water than previously possible. Hurricanes become worse because not only can their clouds hold more water than before, warmer oceans allow hurricanes to become even larger with stronger wind speeds, and enables them to sit on top of cities for longer periods of time. Additionally, climate change is making our usual weather cycles more unusual and unpredictable, meaning that both dry seasons and wet seasons will be intensified.

That’s actually faster than in areas outside of flood zones, where the population increased 13 percent. The United States is spending billions every year to move people into flood-prone areas and keep people living in flood-prone areas. Research shows upwards to 75 percent of people who live in high-risk flood areas in North America are not even aware they are at risk for flooding.\r\n\r\n\r\n            In the USA, FEMA spent approximately $48.6 billion to repair or replace public infrastructure such as roads, bridges and utilities between 1998 and 2014. The National Flood Insurance Program paid $2.9 billion per year to citizens for flood-related losses between 2007 and 2017. These costs will only rise as climate change gets more extreme. Climate scientists have estimated that by 2100 somewhere between 17 and 210 trillion dollars worth of assets will be at flood risk due to rising sea levels, requiring massive investments in flood protection to mitigate disasters annually.

Air pollution is a causal factor in 30% of strokes and 21% of deaths from stroke. Particulate matter air pollutants make brain cells more likely to die when a stroke occurs. There is also evidence that air pollutants make blood inside blood vessels more likely to clot, causing strokes when those clots are dislodged, caught in the brain, and then block blood flow to the brain. This reduces the oxygen supply to brain cells, which then die and cause motor disabilities or death.\r\n\r\n\r\n            A warmer climate makes strokes worse.

As of 2020, the CDC reports that there are approximately 805,000 heart attacks in the US every year. In 2014 and 2015, heart disease was found to cost the US $219 billion annually. Approximately half of the US population is exposed to one of the top risk factors for heart disease. These factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. However, it is less known that exposure to air pollution can also increase the risk of heart disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n            This makes burning fossil fuels a contributor to not only climate change, but also heart disease. Numerous studies link air pollution exposure to heart disease, including one led by Dr. Joel Kaufman. Their study found that long term exposure can “prematurely age blood vessels and contribute to a more rapid buildup of calcium in the coronary artery”. This puts people at higher risk for heart attacks. With so many factors already influencing heart disease, shifting away from burning fossil fuels is necessary for protecting our health. And until we reach zero emissions from burning fossil fuels, citizens can stay healthier by monitoring air quality closer and avoiding exposure.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Increased high temperatures caused by climate change also put more strain on the body and increase the risk of heart attack, especially among the elderly.\r\n          effectId: RzalB19SQSGGVxprHL33Ik\r\n          effectScore: 0.979999999999998\r\n          effectShortDescription: Not only does breathing air pollution from burning fossil fuels increase the risk of heart attacks, increasingly warm air temperatures are also raising the risk of heart attacks.\r\n          effectSolutions:\r\n          - imageUrl: null\r\n            iri: RfqwmaY5oYx5PSw5fhhfPi\r\n            longDescription: Roughly a third of the world’s food is never eaten, which means land and resources used and greenhouse gases emitted in producing it were unnecessary.

Framing your conversation around fairness and equality can help resolve perceived tensions between economic security and climate action. By explaining potential transitionary policies, such as government funding for retraining, we can alleviate the perceived conflict between economic security and climate action. Furthermore, this framing shows how much they have to gain by being ecologically aware and politically involved within their community’s climate response.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Know your limits as a communicator and the limits of framing. Trust is vital in consensus building and it’s important to do what you can, where you can, on a regular basis rather than burning out on arguments. Additionally, research has shown that social influence is likely more important in decision-making than previously thought.

Many people perceive climate change as an abstract issue that won’t affect them directly and climate action is often seen as being a direct threat to economic security or cultural identity.\r\n\r\n\r\n              To navigate this perception of threat, climate communicators stress the importance of ‘meeting people where they’re at’, getting to know their concerns, and framing climate change and climate action in relation to them. ‘Framing’ simply means understanding the concerns and values of who you are addressing, communicating how climate change impacts those issues, and presenting a frame and a pathway that shows how their concerns and values can be protected through climate action.\r\n\r\n\r\n              For example, many people worry that their livelihood will be threatened by economic pressures from climate action. Framing your conversation around fairness and equality can help resolve perceived tensions between economic security and climate action. By explaining potential transitionary policies, such as government funding for retraining, we can alleviate the perceived conflict between economic security and climate action. Furthermore, this framing shows how much they have to gain by being ecologically aware and politically involved within their community’s climate response.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Know your limits as a communicator and the limits of framing. Trust is vital in consensus building and it’s important to do what you can, where you can, on a regular basis rather than burning out on arguments. Additionally, research has shown that social influence is likely more important in decision-making than previously thought. By maximising your communication with as many people as possible, you can change the landscape of local climate discourse and engage the power of natural social networks to support climate communication and positive action, rather than hinder it.\r\n            shortDescription: Tailoring your climate change message about topics or values important to people makes for a more positive and effective conversation.\r\n            solutionSources:\r\n            - https://d3p9z3cj392tgc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/08150054/9781501730795.pdf\r\n            - http://counterfutures.nz/5/Oosterman.pdf\r\n            - http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/students/envs_4800/norgaard_2006.pdf\r\n            - https://publicinterest.org.uk/download/climate-comms/communicating_climate_mass_audiences.pdf\r\n            - https://www.nature.com/articles/463296a\r\n            - https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/12/20/talk-climate-change-family-friends-holidays\r\n            - https://branch.climateaction.tech/2020/10/01/the-story-is-a-forest-how-to-talk-about-climate-change\r\n            - https://davidsuzuki.org/story/navigating-difficult-climate-conversations\r\n            - https://hbr.org/2020/01/a-better-way-to-talk-about-the-climate-crisis\r\n            - https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/18/a-look-at-how-people-around-the-world-view-climate-change\r\n            - https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/important-issues-in-the-2020-election\r\n            - https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/06/how-to-talk-about-climate-change-5-tips-from-the-front-lines\r\n            solutionSpecificMythIRIs: []\r\n            solutionTitle: effective communication framing\r\n            solutionType: mitigation\r\n          - imageUrl: null\r\n            iri: R8PIEqhm36x0Y9CvkgJlidT\r\n            longDescription: \"Fuel-efficiency is critical to reduce road-freight emissions.

Although not the only factor, climate change is contributing to larger, more severe wildfires, and longer wildfire seasons. Warming temperatures and lower precipitation dry out vegetation and soils, allowing fuel to accumulate and making wildfires more likely. Estimates suggest human-caused climate change has doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984 and extended the wildfire season by 78 days relative to the 1970s—almost three additional months per year when a fire could start. Under conservative levels of future warming, 11 states in the U.S. are predicted to experience an increase of 200% or more in average burned area for 2010-2039 relative to 1961-2004 levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Increasing wildfire size and severity pose an enormous threat to animal and human life and property, as vividly demonstrated by the 2020 wildfires in places as disparate as California, Australia, and Brazil. This threat is compounded by increasing human development in fire-prone areas such as forest and chaparral habitats. Policies designed to prevent wildfires such as prescribed burns, which remove fuel from the landscape, can help mitigate this threat, as can individual actions including creating defensible space around homes and buildings. However, curbing the trend of increasing wildfire size and severity will likely require aggressive climate policy aimed at limiting the magnitude of future warming.\r\n          effectId: RLc1ySxaRs4HWkW4m5w2Me\r\n          effectScore: 0.979999999999998\r\n          effectShortDescription: Warmer and drier conditions promote the accumulation of dry vegetation on the landscape, making wildfires more likely.

If an emitter exceeds their allotted GHG amount, they can trade to buy more permits from the state or from businesses who have additional permits and are willing to sell them. \\n\\nOver time, the government lowers the number of available permits each year, thereby creating a scarcity which in turn increases the cost.  The increased cost every year forces the emitters to look either for cleaner alternatives or to reduce their emissions in other ways.

Money can also be directed to assist developing nations with their emissions or help marginalized communities with adapting to climate impacts that disproportionately affect them.\r\n            shortDescription: Increasing carbon taxes encourages greater reduction in emissions and can provide funds for investment in climate-friendly projects.\r\n            solutionSources:\r\n            - https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/10/carbon-tax-most-powerful-way-to-combat-climate-change-imf.html\r\n            - https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/reports/2012/12/06/47052/a-progressive-carbon-tax-will-fight-climate-change-and-stimulate-the-economy\r\n            - https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/what-is-a-carbon-tax-and-how-could-it-help-us-fight-the-climate-crisis\r\n            solutionSpecificMythIRIs:\r\n            - RCw8SmMRRaBEOoHqTzFvZml\r\n            solutionTitle: increase rate of carbon tax\r\n            solutionType: mitigation\r\n          effectSources:\r\n          - https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/ocean-heat-waves-are-rise-and-killing-coral\r\n          - https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-coral-reefs-at-risk\r\n          effectSpecificMythIRIs:\r\n          - R7T07NmeX8SYfysieiycbv4\r\n          - R7hFprQCCizIoO67xtr4tlq\r\n          - R8Qh5dLGvzYwFZpritPBmBh\r\n          effectTitle: increase in coral bleaching and destruction\r\n          imageUrl: https://i.imgur.com/ktZeIPJ.jpg\r\n          isPossiblyLocal: 0\r\n    ClimateEffect:\r\n      title: ClimateEffect\r\n      required:\r\n      - effectDescription\r\n      - effectId\r\n      - effectScore\r\n      - effectShortDescription\r\n      - effectSolutions\r\n      - effectSources\r\n      - effectSpecificMythIRIs\r\n      - effectTitle\r\n      - imageUrl\r\n      - isPossiblyLocal\r\n      type: object\r\n      properties:\r\n        effectDescription:\r\n          type: string\r\n        effectId:\r\n          type: string\r\n        effectScore:\r\n          type: number\r\n        effectShortDescription:\r\n          type: string\r\n        effectSolutions:\r\n          type: array\r\n          items:\r\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/EffectSolution'\r\n          description: ''\r\n        effectSources:\r\n          type: array\r\n          items:\r\n            type: string\r\n          description: ''\r\n        effectSpecificMythIRIs:\r\n          type: array\r\n          items:\r\n            type: string\r\n          description: ''\r\n        effectTitle:\r\n          type: string\r\n        imageUrl:\r\n          type: string\r\n        isPossiblyLocal:\r\n          type: integer\r\n          contentEncoding: int32\r\n      examples:\r\n      - effectDescription: \u003e-\r\n          Tourism supports the livelihoods of an estimated one in ten people worldwide andaround 80% occurs around coastal destinations. Coral reefs are popular and exciting places for sightseeing, swimming, snorkelling, diving and boating. For example, Australia's Great Barrier Reef annually attracts 1.9 million visits, generates AUD$5.4 billion from tourism and supports 54,000 jobs. Florida's Coral Reef has an annual estimated tourism value of $1.1 billion and supports 71,000 jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Warming oceans due to climate change are causing increases in heatwaves occurring in the ocean (marine heatwaves). The frequency of these marine heatwaves has doubled since 1982, increasing coral bleaching and destruction. Already over 50% of coral reefs have been lost. If yearly CO2 emissions aren't reduced, in the future these heatwaves will occur 50 times more often than they do today, causing over 97% of all coral reefs to die off along with much of the coastal marine life they support. The loss of coral reefs makes coastal destinations less attractive to tourists and negatively affects local economies.\r\n        effectId: R9JAWzfiZ9haeNhHiCpTWkr\r\n        effectScore: 27.38\r\n        effectShortDescription: The increase in coral bleaching and destruction seen in many tourist destinations is leading to declines in tourism.

Project Drawdown assumes that as regenerative annual cropping becomes more widely used, farms that have already adopted conservation agriculture will convert to these more effective soil fertility practices in response to consumer demand for fewer harmful herbicides. The benefits of that conversion are counted by the regenerative annual cropping solution. Nonetheless, conservation agriculture offers significant benefits in the interim, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 13.4-9.4 gigatons based on average carbon sequestration rates of 0.25- 0.78 tons of carbon per hectare per year, depending on region.
