It can also be used to test for a \"decommissioned\" address.\n\n        ### Testing\n\n        To test your implementation of our API we have a range of test UDPRNs that yield both successful and unsuccessful responses to your request. They are the following:\n\n        - `0` Returns a successful UDPRN lookup response `2000`\n        - `-1` Returns \"UDPRN not found\", error `4044`\n        - `-2` Returns \"no lookups remaining\", error `4020`\n        - `-3` Returns \"daily (or individual) lookup limit breached\", error `4021`\n\n        Test requests will undergo usual authentication and restriction rules (individual and daily lookup limits) to surface any problems you may have during implementation. However, it will not count towards a postcode lookup on your key.\n\n        ### Pricing\n\n        Per lookup charges apply. Empty responses are not charged.\n\n        ### Data Source\n\n        Royal Mail (Postcode Address File), Ordnance Survey (Code-Point Open).\n      operationId: UpdrnToAddress\n      parameters:\n        - description: UDPRNs are an eight digit unique numeric code (e.g. 25962203) for any premise on the Postcode Address File.

Retrieve partial address suggestions via `/autocomplete/addresses`\n        2. Retrieve the entire address by following the URL provided by the suggestion\n\n        Step 2 will decrement your lookup balance.\n\n        Please note, this API is [not intended to be a free standalone resource](#pricing).\n\n        ### Testing\n\n        `ID1 1QD` will return address suggestions, that when retrieved via `/udprn/:id` will not affect your balance.\n\n        ### Notes\n\n        #### Suggestion Format\n\n        The suggestion format is prone to change over time. Attempts to parse the suggestion may result in your integration breaking. Instead use the suggestion as is.\n\n        #### Querying with a Postcode\n\n        If a postcode is passed as a query, all addresses for that postcode will be listed as the result if the limit parameter is not supplied. If a postcode forms only part of the query, your autocomplete results will be filtered by that postcode.\n\n        #### Authentication\n\n        When using the autocomplete API, low request latency is essential in delivering a speedy list of suggestions to the user. For this reason we recommend using query string authentication (i.e. `api_key=foo`) rather than HTTP Header authentication (i.e. `Authorization: IDEALPOSTCODES api_key=\"foo\"`). The latter will incur additional latency as most browsers will trigger a preflight OPTIONS request for each key press.\n\n        #### Querying Multiple Residence\n\n        For Multiple Residence enabled keys, any Multiple Residence households will also return a UMPRN id, which can be retrieved with the `/umprn/` endpoint. Note that Multiple Residence households will always have a parent premise with a UDPRN, and a single UDPRN premise may have many Multiple Residence households with different UMPRNs. For instance:\n\n        ```\n        {\n          \"result\": {\n            \"hits\": [\n              {\n                \"suggestion\": \"10 Downings, London, E6\",\n                \"urls\": {\n                  \"udprn\": \"/v1/udprn/7944730\"\n                },\n                \"udprn\": 7944730\n              },\n              {\n                \"suggestion\": \"10 Downing Grove, Hull, HU9\",\n                \"urls\": {\n                  \"udprn\": \"/v1/udprn/11168744\",\n                  \"umprn\": \"/v1/umprn/882919\"\n                },\n                \"udprn\": 11168744,\n                \"umprn\": 882919\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n          \"code\": 2000,\n          \"message\": \"Success\"\n        }\n        ```\n\n        ### Rate Limiting\n\n        You can make up to 3000 requests to the autocomplete API within a 5 minute span. The HTTP Header contains information on your current rate limit.\n\n        | Header                  | Description |\n        | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n        | `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | The maximum number of requests that can be made in 5 minutes                           |\n        | `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The remaining requests within the current rate limit window                            |\n        | `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | The time when the rate limit window resets in Unix Time (seconds) or UTC Epoch seconds |\n\n        ### Pricing\n\n        This API currently does not affect your balance. However, subsequent searches require a paid request (e.g. a UDPRN search). This paid request, will yield the complete address.\n\n        Please note, this API is not intended as a standalone free resource. Integrations that consistently make autocomplete requests without a paid request to resolve an address may be disrupted via tightened rate limits. Continued misuse will result in account suspension.\n\n        ### Data Source\n\n        Royal Mail (Postcode Address File).\n      operationId: AddressAutocomplete\n      parameters:\n        - description: Specifies the address you wish to query.

They are the following:\n\n        - `ID1 1QD` Returns a successful postcode lookup response `2000`\n        - `ID1 KFA` Returns \"postcode not found\", error `4040`\n        - `ID1 CLIP` Returns \"no lookups remaining\", error `4020`\n        - `ID1 CHOP` Returns \"daily (or individual) lookup limit breached\", error `4021`\n\n        Test requests will undergo usual authentication and restriction rules (individual and daily lookup limits) to surface any problems you may have during implementation. However, it will not count towards a postcode lookup on your key.\n\n        ### Multiple Residence Dataset \u0026 Pagination\n\n        For keys which use the Multiple Residence dataset, there are a small number of postcodes which yield more than Royal Mail's maximum allowed return (of 100 addresses) per request. Multiple Residence data users have the option of paginating postcode queries if the limit is reached.\n\n        #### Multiple Residence: Additional Query Parameters\n\n        | Property | Description                                                                          |\n        | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n        | `page`   | 0 indexed indicator of the page of results to receive.
