In some cases, such as “ground cinnamon” this is ambiguous because a user can purchase whole cinnamon sticks and grind them (which would treat grinding as a preparation step) or a user can purchase the product `ground cinnamon` (which has no preparation steps).\\n\\n- For ambiguous cases, the parser attempts to choose the product that is more common. For example, “ground cinnamon” is treated as a product name because most users purchase cinnamon pre-ground. In contrast, “diced celery” is interpreted as product=`celery`, preparationNotes=`diced` because users more commonly dice celery instead of buying pre-diced celery.\",\n                                \"type\": \"string\"\n                              },\n                              \"usdaInfo\": {\n                                \"description\": \"If Zestful can match the ingredient to a food in the USDA database, this contains a dictionary of information about the matching USDA entry\",\n                                \"type\": \"object\",\n                                \"properties\": {\n                                  \"fdcId\": {\n                                    \"description\": \"The FDC ID for the food in the USDA FoodData Central database (e.g., `168833`)\",\n                                    \"type\": \"string\"\n                                  },\n                                  \"matchMethod\": {\n                                    \"description\": \"The method that Zestful used to match the ingredient to a USDA entry.
