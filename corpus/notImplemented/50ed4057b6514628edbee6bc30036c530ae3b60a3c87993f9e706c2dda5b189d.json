These\n    rates are recognized globally as the standard by banks, fund managers, and\n    index compilers; increasingly these rates are also being used for benchmark\n    currency trading. In 1994, WM Company began calculating closing spot rates.\n    Closing spot rates provide a standard set of currency rates so that\n    portfolio valuations can be compared to each other and their performances\n    measured against benchmarks, without having discrepancies caused by exchange\n    rates. Closing spot rates are recorded at 16:00 GMT.*\u003c/p\u003e\nservers:\n  - url: https://api.factset.com/content\n    description: Production\nsecurity:\n  - FactSetApiKey: []\n  - FactSetOAuth2: []\npaths:\n  /foreign-exchange/v1/spots:\n    get:\n      tags:\n        - Spots\n      summary: Gets spots for a list of currency pairs\n      operationId: getSpots\n      description: \u003e\n        Gets FX Spot rates for a requested currency pair, date range, and\n        frequency.
