They are defined at create time,\n\n        with optional defaults, and can be overridden at run time.\n\n\n        If `localCopy` is unset, then the parameter specifies a string that\n\n        is passed as-is into the pipeline, as the value of the environment\n\n        variable with the given name.  A default value can be optionally\n\n        specified at create time. The default can be overridden at run time\n\n        using the inputs map. If no default is given, a value must be\n\n        supplied at runtime.\n\n\n        If `localCopy` is defined, then the parameter specifies a data\n\n        source or sink, both in Google Cloud Storage and on the Docker container\n\n        where the pipeline computation is run. The service account associated with\n\n        the Pipeline (by\n\n        default the project's Compute Engine service account) must have access to the\n\n        Google Cloud Storage paths.\n\n\n        At run time, the Google Cloud Storage paths can be overridden if a default\n\n        was provided at create time, or must be set otherwise. The pipeline runner\n\n        should add a key/value pair to either the inputs or outputs map. The\n\n        indicated data copies will be carried out before/after pipeline execution,\n\n        just as if the corresponding arguments were provided to `gsutil cp`.\n\n\n        For example: Given the following `PipelineParameter`, specified\n\n        in the `inputParameters` list:\n\n\n        ```\n\n        {name: \"input_file\", localCopy: {path: \"file.txt\", disk: \"pd1\"}}\n\n        ```\n\n\n        where `disk` is defined in the `PipelineResources` object as:\n\n\n        ```\n\n        {name: \"pd1\", mountPoint: \"/mnt/disk/\"}\n\n        ```\n\n\n        We create a disk named `pd1`, mount it on the host VM, and map\n\n        `/mnt/pd1` to `/mnt/disk` in the docker container.  At\n\n        runtime, an entry for `input_file` would be required in the inputs\n\n        map, such as:\n\n\n        ```\n          inputs[\"input_file\"] = \"gs://my-bucket/bar.txt\"\n        ```\n\n\n        This would generate the following gsutil call:\n\n\n        ```\n          gsutil cp gs://my-bucket/bar.txt /mnt/pd1/file.txt\n        ```\n\n\n        The file `/mnt/pd1/file.txt` maps to `/mnt/disk/file.txt` in the\n\n        Docker container.
