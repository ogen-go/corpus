It delivers a granular view for investors by classifying\n    companies using a bottom-up approach according to the products and services\n    they provide. By combining this approach with a top-level grouping based on\n    companies' behavior similarities and stock co-movement, FactSet RBICS\n    delivers unprecedented precision for 1,400+ sector groups.\n\n\n    RBICS Focus is a six level classification which highlights the companys main\n    business. It is based on the company business line/s that stand for majority\n    of a the revenue that the company generates. Updated monthly.
