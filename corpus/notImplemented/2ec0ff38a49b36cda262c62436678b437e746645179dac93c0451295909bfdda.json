The first time submit_post is called with a post, session should\n          be a new empty object (eg. {}).

Some post warnings passed to the callback object\n          have a preference_key string property so that users can opt out of those warnings in the future.\n          To save this opt-out preference, set the property indicated by the preference_key in the preferences\n          object (eg. preferences[preference_key] = 1).  The preferences object is only read by submit_post and\n          never modified - it is up to the client to initialize, modify and persist the preferences object.\n\n        - **callback** is a function used to return the result of the post submission. It is called and passed\n          one argument - an object with five properties {result, message, preference_key, identifier, session}.\n          The result property is a string that is one of: success, error, warning.  The identifier property is\n          set for errors and warnings and will contain a string that represents the type of error or warning that\n          occurred.\n\n          A success result indicates that the post was submitted successfully. Note that posts may not\n          appear instantly after submission because the moderators of many groups may have additional\n          automatic or manual review processes in place that can delay the publishing of a post.\n          \n          An error result indicates that there is an error with the post to show the user and the message property\n          will contain text describing the error.\n\n          A warning result indicates that there is a warning about the post to show the user and the\n          message property will contain a string describing the warning.  A warning result doesn't prevent a post from\n          being submitted, to continue the submission process after a warning result, just re-submit the post\n          (with the updated session object) to temporarily override that specific warning.\n\n          Certain types of warnings can be opted out of.
