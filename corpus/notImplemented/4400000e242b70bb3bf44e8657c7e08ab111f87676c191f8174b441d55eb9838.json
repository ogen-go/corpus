APIs are important for\n    customers because they allow their technical staff and programmers to build\n    tools that help them do their job more effectively (in this case, to keep up\n    with security vulnerability information).\n\n    For more information about the Cisco PSIRT openVuln API visit\n    https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/discover/overview\n\n\n    For detail steps on how to use the API go\n    to:https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/get-started/getting-started.gsp\n\n\n    This is a beta release of a swagger YAML for the Cisco PSIRT openVuln API\n\n\n    To access the API sign in with your Cisco CCO account at\n    http://apiconsole.cisco.com and register an application\n\n    to recieve a client_id and a client_secret\n\n\n    You can then get your token using curl or any other method you prefer.\n\n\n    'curl -s -k -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" -X POST -d\n    \"client_id=\" -d \"client_secret=\" -d\n    \"grant_type=client_credentials\" https://cloudsso.cisco.com/as/token.oauth2'\n\n\n    You will receive an access token as demonstrated in the following example:\n     '{\"access_token\":\"I7omWtBDAieSiUX3shOxNJfuy4J6\",\"token_type\":\"Bearer\",\"expires_in\":3599}'\n\n    In Swagger, click on Change Authentication\n\n\n    enter the text \"I7omWtBDAieSiUX3shOxNJfuy4J6\" (which is the token you\n    received)\n\n\n    then click on \"Try this operation\"\n  title: Cisco PSIRT openVuln\n  version: 0.0.3\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    - security\n  x-origin:\n    - format: swagger\n      url: \u003e-\n        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CiscoPSIRT/openVulnAPI/master/swagger/openVulnAPISwagger0_0_3.yaml\n      version: '2.0'\n  x-providerName: cisco.com\npaths:\n  '/security/advisories/cvrf/advisory/{advisory_id}':\n    get:\n      description: \u003e\n        Used to obtain an advisory in CVRF format for a given advisory ID\n        `advisory_id` (i.e., cisco-sa-20150819-pcp)\n      parameters:\n        - description: advisory ID\n          in: path\n          name: advisory_id\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n            format: cisco-sa-XXX\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Successful response\n      security:\n        - psirt_openvuln_api_auth:\n            - 'read:cvrf'\n            - 'read:oval'\n  /security/advisories/cvrf/all:\n    get:\n      description: \u003e\n        Used to obtain all advisories in Common Vulnerability Reporting Format\n        (CVRF).
