For\n\n            example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an\n\n            unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC.\n\n\n            If this value is not provided but expiry_date is, expiry_date is\n\n            used.\n\n\n            If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks\n\n            set by UpdateJobRequest.update_job_fields. If the field masks include\n\n            expiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is\n\n            updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's last\n\n            update time.

These custom fields store arbitrary\n\n            string values, and can be used for purposes not covered by\n\n            the structured fields. For the best search experience, use of the\n\n            structured rather than custom fields is recommended.\n\n\n            Data stored in these custom fields fields are indexed and\n\n            searched against by keyword searches (see\n\n            SearchJobsRequest.custom_field_filters][]).\n\n\n            The map key must be a number between 1-20.

The order of\n\n            address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country/region of the\n\n            address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is\n\n            used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and\n\n            \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of\n\n            an address can be selected based on the language.\n\n\n            The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists\n\n            of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the\n\n            address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very\n\n            approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be\n\n            made about any of the address components until it was at least\n\n            partially resolved.\n\n\n            Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and\n\n            then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured\n\n            addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be\n\n            localities or administrative areas).\n          items:\n            type: string\n          type: array\n        administrativeArea:\n          description: \u003e-\n            Optional.
