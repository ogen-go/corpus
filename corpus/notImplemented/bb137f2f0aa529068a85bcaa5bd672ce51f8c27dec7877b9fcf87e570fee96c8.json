Using\n    a four level taxonomy structure, understand the companies'\n    Super-Region--\u003eRegion--\u003eArea--\u003eCountry revenue breakdowns. Quickly\n    understand a company’s revenue exposure in countries impacted by\n    geopolitical, macroeconomic, and market risk. Understand the geographic\n    footprint of a company based on sources of revenue versus country of\n    domicile, and analyze global revenue exposures at the company, index, or\n    portfolio level.\u003cp\u003e Geographic revenue has historically been difficult to\n    analyze due to companies’ non-standard and incomplete reporting. Investors\n    relying solely on this as-reported data are limited in their ability to\n    compare, aggregate or screen exposures across a universe or portfolio of\n    companies. To achieve normalization, FactSet GeoRev captures data through a\n    proprietary four-level geographic classification structure. An estimation\n    algorithm based on GDP weighting and accounting logic is then applied to\n    solve for any non-explicit disclosures. The result is a consistent,\n    accurate, and flexible dataset that can take a company’s revenues and break\n    them down into any geographic country or region categories.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs markets\n    become more integrated and companies expand operations beyond their domestic\n    markets, GeoRev provides a new and valuable country factor to help investors\n    discover alpha, model risk exposure, optimize portfolio weighting, and\n    improve fund administration and reporting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eData Frequency -  Annual;\n    Update Frequency - Daily. 49,000+ Publically Listed Companies.
