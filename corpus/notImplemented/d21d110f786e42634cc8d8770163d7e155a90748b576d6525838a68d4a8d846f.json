A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`.

List of peer identities to match for authorization. At least one principal should match. Each peer can be an exact match, or a prefix match (example, \"namespace/*\") or a suffix match (example, // */service-account\") or a presence match \"*\". Authorization based on the principal name without certificate validation (configured by ServerTlsPolicy resource) is considered insecure.\n          items:\n            type: string\n          type: array\n      type: object\n    Status:\n      description: \"The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.
