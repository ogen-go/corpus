The task attempt has failed if\n\n        the app's handler returns a non-2xx response code or Cloud Tasks does\n\n        not receive response before the deadline. Failed\n\n        tasks will be retried according to the\n\n        retry configuration. `503` (Service Unavailable) is\n\n        considered an App Engine system error instead of an application error and\n\n        will cause Cloud Tasks' traffic congestion control to temporarily throttle\n\n        the queue's dispatches. Unlike other types of task targets, a `429` (Too Many\n\n        Requests) response from an app handler does not cause traffic congestion\n\n        control to throttle the queue.\n      properties:\n        appEngineRouting:\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/AppEngineRouting\"\n        body:\n          description: \u003e-\n            HTTP request body.\n\n\n            A request body is allowed only if the HTTP method is POST or PUT.

The default can be overridden by explicitly\n              setting `Content-Type` to a particular media type when the\n              task is created.\n              For example, `Content-Type` can be set to `\"application/json\"`.\n            * `Content-Length`: This is computed by Cloud Tasks.

The state of the queue.\n\n\n            `state` can only be changed by called\n\n            PauseQueue,\n\n            ResumeQueue, or uploading\n\n            [queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/queueref).\n\n            UpdateQueue cannot be used to change `state`.\n          enum:\n            - STATE_UNSPECIFIED\n            - RUNNING\n            - PAUSED\n            - DISABLED\n          type: string\n      type: object\n    RateLimits:\n      description: \u003e-\n        Rate limits.\n\n\n        This message determines the maximum rate that tasks can be dispatched by a\n\n        queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is a first task attempt or a retry.\n\n\n        Note: The debugging command, RunTask, will run a task\n\n        even if the queue has reached its RateLimits.\n      properties:\n        maxBurstSize:\n          description: \u003e\n            Output only. The max burst size.\n\n\n            Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when\n\n            many tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field\n\n            allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly\n\n            after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when\n\n            many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time.\n\n\n            The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket)\n\n            algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each\n\n            queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum\n\n            specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a\n\n            token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until\n\n            the queue's bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be\n\n            continuously refilled with new tokens based on\n\n            max_dispatches_per_second.\n\n\n            Cloud Tasks will pick the value of `max_burst_size` based on the\n\n            value of\n\n            max_dispatches_per_second.\n\n\n            For App Engine queues that were created or updated using\n\n            `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to\n\n            [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size).\n\n            Since `max_burst_size` is output only, if\n\n            UpdateQueue is called on a queue\n\n            created by `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` will be reset based\n\n            on the value of\n\n            max_dispatches_per_second,\n\n            regardless of whether\n\n            max_dispatches_per_second\n\n            is updated.\n          format: int32\n          type: integer\n        maxConcurrentDispatches:\n          description: \u003e-\n            The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows\n\n            to be dispatched for this queue.
