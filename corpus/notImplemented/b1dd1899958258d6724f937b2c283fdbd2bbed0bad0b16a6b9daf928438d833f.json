The placeholders follow\n\n            the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Furthermore, placeholders can have prefixes\n\n            and suffixes. Thus, the glyph format follows the pattern\n\n            `\u003cprefix\u003e%[nesting_level]\u003csuffix\u003e`. Note that the prefix and suffix are\n\n            optional and can be arbitrary strings.\n\n\n            For example, the glyph format `%0.` indicates that the rendered glyph will\n\n            replace the placeholder with the corresponding glyph for nesting level 0\n\n            followed by a period as the suffix. So a list with a glyph type of\n\n            UPPER_ALPHA and\n\n            glyph format `%0.` at nesting level 0 will result in a list with rendered\n\n            glyphs\n\n            \u003cp\u003e`A.`\n\n            \u003cp\u003e`B.`\n\n            \u003cp\u003e`C.`\n\n\n            The glyph format can contain placeholders for the current nesting level as\n\n            well as placeholders for parent nesting levels. For example, a\n\n            list can have a glyph format of `%0.` at nesting level 0 and a\n\n            glyph format of `%0.%1.` at nesting level 1. Assuming both nesting levels\n\n            have DECIMAL glyph\n\n            types, this would result in a list with rendered glyphs\n\n            \u003cp\u003e`1.`\n\n            \u003cp\u003e`2.`\n\n            \u003cp\u003e`  2.1.`\n\n            \u003cp\u003e`  2.2.`\n\n            \u003cp\u003e`3.`\n\n\n            For nesting levels that are ordered, the string that replaces a placeholder\n\n            in the glyph format for a particular paragraph depends on the paragraph's\n\n            order within the list.\n          type: string\n        glyphSymbol:\n          description: \u003e-\n            A custom glyph symbol used by bullets when paragraphs at this level\n            of\n\n            nesting are unordered.\n\n\n            The glyph symbol replaces placeholders within the glyph_format. For example, if the\n\n            glyph_symbol is the solid circle corresponding to Unicode U+25cf code\n\n            point and the glyph_format is `%0`, the rendered\n\n            glyph would be the solid circle.\n          type: string\n        glyphType:\n          description: \u003e-\n            The type of glyph used by bullets when paragraphs at this level of\n\n            nesting are ordered.\n\n\n            The glyph type determines the type of glyph used to replace placeholders\n\n            within the glyph_format\n\n            when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered.

This results in a new revision of the\n\n            document which incorporates both the changes in the request and the\n\n            collaborator changes, and the Docs server will resolve conflicting\n\n            changes. When using `target_revision_id`, the API client can be thought\n\n            of as another collaborator of the document.\n\n\n            The target revision ID may only be used to write to recent versions of a\n\n            document. If the target revision is too far behind the latest revision,\n\n            the request will not be processed and will return a 400 bad request error\n\n            and the request should be retried after reading the latest version of the\n\n            document. In most cases a `revision_id` will remain valid for use as a\n\n            target revision for several minutes after it is read, but for\n\n            frequently-edited documents this window may be shorter.\n          type: string\n      type: object\n",
