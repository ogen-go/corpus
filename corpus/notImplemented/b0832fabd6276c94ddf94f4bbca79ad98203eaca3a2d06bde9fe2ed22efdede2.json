All indexes are zero-based. Indexes are half\n        open, i.e. the start index is inclusive and the end index is exclusive --\n        [start_index, end_index). Missing indexes indicate the range is unbounded\n        on that side. For example, if `\"Sheet1\"` is sheet ID 0, then: `Sheet1!A1:A1\n        == sheet_id: 0, start_row_index: 0, end_row_index: 1, start_column_index:\n        0, end_column_index: 1` `Sheet1!A3:B4 == sheet_id: 0, start_row_index: 2,\n        end_row_index: 4, start_column_index: 0, end_column_index: 2` `Sheet1!A:B\n        == sheet_id: 0, start_column_index: 0, end_column_index: 2` `Sheet1!A5:B ==\n        sheet_id: 0, start_row_index: 4, start_column_index: 0, end_column_index:\n        2` `Sheet1 == sheet_id:0` The start index must always be less than or equal\n        to the end index. If the start index equals the end index, then the range\n        is empty. Empty ranges are typically not meaningful and are usually rendered\n        in the UI as `#REF!`.'\n      properties:\n        endColumnIndex:\n          description: The end column (exclusive) of the range, or not set if unbounded.\n          format: int32\n          type: integer\n        endRowIndex:\n          description: The end row (exclusive) of the range, or not set if unbounded.\n          format: int32\n          type: integer\n        sheetId:\n          description: The sheet this range is on.\n          format: int32\n          type: integer\n        startColumnIndex:\n          description: The start column (inclusive) of the range, or not set if unbounded.\n          format: int32\n          type: integer\n        startRowIndex:\n          description: The start row (inclusive) of the range, or not set if unbounded.\n          format: int32\n          type: integer\n      type: object\n    HistogramChartSpec:\n      description: A histogram chart.
