Note: Before requesting to receive voided subscription purchases, you must switch to use orderId in the response which uniquely identifies one-time purchases and subscriptions. Otherwise, you will receive multiple subscription orders with the same PurchaseToken, because subscription renewal orders share the same PurchaseToken.\"\n          in: query\n          name: type\n          schema:\n            type: integer\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/VoidedPurchasesListResponse\"\n          description: Successful response\n      security:\n        - Oauth2:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/androidpublisher\n          Oauth2c:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/androidpublisher\n      tags:\n        - purchases\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/_.xgafv\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/access_token\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/alt\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/callback\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/fields\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/key\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/oauth_token\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/prettyPrint\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/quotaUser\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/upload_protocol\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/uploadType\"\n  \"/androidpublisher/v3/applications/{packageName}/reviews\":\n    get:\n      description: Lists all reviews.\n      operationId: androidpublisher.reviews.list\n      parameters:\n        - description: Package name of the app.\n          in: path\n          name: packageName\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: How many results the list operation should return.\n          in: query\n          name: maxResults\n          schema:\n            type: integer\n        - description: The index of the first element to return.\n          in: query\n          name: startIndex\n          schema:\n            type: integer\n        - description: Pagination token.
