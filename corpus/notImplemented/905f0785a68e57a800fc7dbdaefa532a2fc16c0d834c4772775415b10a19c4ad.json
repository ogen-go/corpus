NOTE: the `name` binding allows API services to override the binding to use different resource name schemes, such as `users/*/operations`. To override the binding, API services can add a binding such as `\\\"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations\\\"` to their service configuration. For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.\"\n      operationId: dialogflow.projects.operations.list\n      parameters:\n        - description: The name of the operation's parent resource.\n          in: path\n          name: name\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: The standard list filter.\n          in: query\n          name: filter\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: The standard list page size.\n          in: query\n          name: pageSize\n          schema:\n            type: integer\n        - description: The standard list page token.\n          in: query\n          name: pageToken\n          schema:\n            type: string\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/GoogleLongrunningListOperationsResponse\"\n          description: Successful response\n      security:\n        - Oauth2:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n          Oauth2c:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n        - Oauth2:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/dialogflow\n          Oauth2c:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/dialogflow\n      tags:\n        - projects\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/_.xgafv\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/access_token\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/alt\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/callback\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/fields\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/key\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/oauth_token\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/prettyPrint\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/quotaUser\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/upload_protocol\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/uploadType\"\n  \"/v3/{name}:cancel\":\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/_.xgafv\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/access_token\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/alt\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/callback\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/fields\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/key\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/oauth_token\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/prettyPrint\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/quotaUser\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/upload_protocol\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/uploadType\"\n    post:\n      description: Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation.

When a flow initially becomes active, the start page page becomes the current page. For each conversational turn, the current page will either stay the same or transition to another page.

If a person says to you \"they are orange\", you need context in order to understand what \"they\" is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts.

Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts.
