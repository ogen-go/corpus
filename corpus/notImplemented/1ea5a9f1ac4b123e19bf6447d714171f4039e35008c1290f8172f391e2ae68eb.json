It is possible for a subscription\n            to have many concurrent, overlapping suspension reasons. A subscription''s\n            `STATUS` is `SUSPENDED` until all pending suspensions are removed. Possible\n            options include: - `PENDING_TOS_ACCEPTANCE` - The customer has not logged\n            in and accepted the G Suite Resold Terms of Services. - `RENEWAL_WITH_TYPE_CANCEL`\n            - The customer''s commitment ended and their service was cancelled at\n            the end of their term. - `RESELLER_INITIATED` - A manual suspension invoked\n            by a Reseller. - `TRIAL_ENDED` - The customer''s trial expired without\n            a plan selected. - `OTHER` - The customer is suspended for an internal\n            Google reason (e.g. abuse or otherwise).
