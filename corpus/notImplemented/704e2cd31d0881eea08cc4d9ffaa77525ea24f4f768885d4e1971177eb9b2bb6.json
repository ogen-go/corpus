Using a four level taxonomy structure, understand the companies' Super-Region--\u003eRegion--\u003eArea--\u003eCountry revenue breakdowns. Quickly understand a company’s revenue exposure in countries impacted by geopolitical, macroeconomic, and market risk. Understand the geographic footprint of a company based on sources of revenue versus country of domicile, and analyze global revenue exposures at the company, index, or portfolio level.\u003cp\u003e Geographic revenue has historically been difficult to analyze due to companies’ non-standard and incomplete reporting. Investors relying solely on this as-reported data are limited in their ability to compare, aggregate or screen exposures across a universe or portfolio of companies. To achieve normalization, FactSet GeoRev captures data through a proprietary four-level geographic classification structure. An estimation algorithm based on GDP weighting and accounting logic is then applied to solve for any non-explicit disclosures. The result is a consistent, accurate, and flexible dataset that can take a company’s revenues and break them down into any geographic country or region categories.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs markets become more integrated and companies expand operations beyond their domestic markets, GeoRev provides a new and valuable country factor to help investors discover alpha, model risk exposure, optimize portfolio weighting, and improve fund administration and reporting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eData Frequency -  Annual; Update Frequency - Daily. 49,000+ Publically Listed Companies.
