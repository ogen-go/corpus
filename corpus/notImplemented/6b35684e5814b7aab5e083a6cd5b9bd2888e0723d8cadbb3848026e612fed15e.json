Note that a null pointer should not have members. 5) An unnamed value: int* p = new int(7); { // Captured variable name: \"p\", value: \"0x00500500\", type: \"int*\", members { value: \"7\", type: \"int\" } } 6) An unnamed pointer where the pointee was not captured: int* p = new int(7); int** pp = \u0026p; { // Captured variable name: \"pp\", value: \"0x00500500\", type: \"int**\", members { value: \"0x00400400\", type: \"int*\" status { is_error: true, description: { format: \"unavailable\" } } } } } To optimize computation, memory and network traffic, variables that repeat in the output multiple times can be stored once in a shared variable table and be referenced using the `var_table_index` field. The variables stored in the shared table are nameless and are essentially a partition of the complete variable. To reconstruct the complete variable, merge the referencing variable with the referenced variable. When using the shared variable table, the following variables: T x = { 3, 7 }; T* p = \u0026x; T\u0026 r = x; { name: \"x\", var_table_index: 3, type: \"T\" } // Captured variables { name: \"p\", value \"0x00500500\", type=\"T*\", var_table_index: 3 } { name: \"r\", type=\"T\u0026\", var_table_index: 3 } { // Shared variable table entry #3: members { name: \"m1\", value: \"3\", type: \"int\" }, members { name: \"m2\", value: \"7\", type: \"int\" } } Note that the pointer address is stored with the referencing variable and not with the referenced variable. This allows the referenced variable to be shared between pointers and references. The type field is optional.
