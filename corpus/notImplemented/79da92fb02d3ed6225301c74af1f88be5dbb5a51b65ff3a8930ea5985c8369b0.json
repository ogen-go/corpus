If the order is in a valid state for a refund, a refund will be scheduled. If the order hasn't been paid for, the order will be marked as cancelled and may no longer be changed.\\n\\nNote that this could be used in a PATCH to set the status of an order to cancelled. However, providing this functional endpoint allows for different access control to this endpoint (path + verb), e.g. support staff only, whereas using a PATCH would require enforcing access controls within the endpoint implementation itself. \\n\"\r\n      operationId: CancelOrder\r\n      parameters:\r\n      - name: orderId\r\n        in: path\r\n        description: The order identifier to be retrieved\r\n        required: true\r\n        style: simple\r\n        schema:\r\n          type: string\r\n      responses:\r\n        200:\r\n          description: Success\r\n          headers: {}\r\n          content:\r\n            application/json:\r\n              schema:\r\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/OrderDetails'\r\n        401:\r\n          description: Request failed, This is the response received when a request is made with invalid API credentials\r\n        403:\r\n          description: Request failed, This is the response received when a request is made with valid API credentials towards an API endpoint or resource you do not have access to.\r\n        404:\r\n          description: Request failed, This is the response received when a request is made and there no data is found for the path parameter.\r\n      deprecated: false\r\n  /orders/{orderId}/payments:\r\n    post:\r\n      tags:\r\n      - OrderPayments\r\n      summary: SubmitPaymentDetailsForOrder\r\n      description: \u003e\r\n        Adds a partial or full credit card payment to the Order.
