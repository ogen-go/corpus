A `Policy` is a collection of\n        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single\n        `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups,\n        and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each\n        `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some\n        types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`,\n        which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the\n        expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes\n        of the request, the resource, or both.

Each occurrence of\n            a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings`\n            grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other\n            principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings`\n            in the `Policy`.\n          items:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/Binding'\n          type: array\n        etag:\n          description: '`etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way\n            to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each\n            other.

If you omit this field,\n            then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`\n            policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.'\n          format: byte\n          type: string\n        version:\n          description: 'Specifies the format of the policy.
