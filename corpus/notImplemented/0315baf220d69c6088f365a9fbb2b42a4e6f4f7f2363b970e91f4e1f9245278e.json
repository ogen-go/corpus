After this timestamp, the\n\n            job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The\n\n            expired job can't be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and\n\n            ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or\n\n            updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and\n\n            opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired\n\n            job fails if there is another existing open job with same company_name,\n\n            language_code and requisition_id.\n\n\n            The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the\n\n            overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs\n\n            count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are\n\n            cleaned first.

For\n\n            example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an\n\n            unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC.\n\n\n            If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks\n\n            set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include\n\n            expiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is\n\n            updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's last\n\n            update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn't updated.\n          format: google-datetime\n          type: string\n        postingPublishTime:\n          description: \u003e-\n            Optional.

The order of\n\n            address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country/region of the\n\n            address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is\n\n            used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and\n\n            \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of\n\n            an address can be selected based on the language.\n\n\n            The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists\n\n            of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the\n\n            address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very\n\n            approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be\n\n            made about any of the address components until it was at least\n\n            partially resolved.\n\n\n            Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and\n\n            then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured\n\n            addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be\n\n            localities or administrative areas).\n          items:\n            type: string\n          type: array\n        administrativeArea:\n          description: \u003e-\n            Optional.

When multiple distance\n\n            centers are provided, a job that is close to any of the distance centers\n\n            would have a high rank. When a job has multiple locations, the job location\n\n            closest to one of the distance centers will be used. Jobs that don't have\n\n            locations will be ranked at the bottom. Distance is calculated with a\n\n            precision of 11.3 meters (37.4 feet).
