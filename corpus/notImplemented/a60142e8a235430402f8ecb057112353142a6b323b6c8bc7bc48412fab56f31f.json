Call\n    createShippingQuote to get a list of live shipping rates. The rates\n    returned are all valid for a specific time window and all quoted prices are\n    at eBay-negotiated rates. Select one of the live rates and using its\n    associated rateId, create a \"shipment\" for the package by calling\n    createFromShippingQuote. Creating a shipment completes an agreement,\n    and the cost of the base service and any added shipping options are summed\n    into the returned totalShippingCost value. This action also generates\n    a shipping label that you can use to ship the package.  The total cost of\n    the shipment is incurred when the package is shipped using the supplied\n    shipping label. Sellers must set up a payment method via their eBay account before they can use the methods in\n    this API to create a shipment and the associated shipping label.\n  x-ballerina-init-description: \u003e- \n    The connector initialization requires setting the API credentials. \n    \n    Create a [developer account](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/creating-edp-account.html) \n    and obtain tokens following [this guide](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/oauth-tokens.html).\n  contact:\n    name: 'eBay Inc,'\n  license:\n    name: eBay API License Agreement\n    url: 'https://go.developer.ebay.com/api-license-agreement'\n  version: v1_beta.0.0\nservers:\n  - url: 'https://api.ebay.com{basePath}'\n    description: Production\n    variables:\n      basePath:\n        default: /sell/logistics/v1_beta\npaths:\n  /shipping_quote:\n    post:\n      tags:\n        - shipping_quote\n      summary: \u003e-\n        The createShippingQuote method returns a shipping quote that contains a\n        list of live rates. Each rate represents an offer made by a\n        shipping carrier for a specific service and each offer has a live quote\n        for the base service cost. Rates have a time window in which they are\n        live, and rates expire when their purchase window ends. If\n        offered by the carrier, rates can include shipping options (and their\n        associated prices), and users can add any offered shipping option to the\n        base service should they desire. Also, depending on the services\n        required, rates can also include pickup and delivery windows. Each rate\n        is for a single package and is based on the following information: The\n        shipping origin The shipping destination The package size (weight and\n        dimensions) Rates are identified by a unique eBay-assigned rateId and\n        rates are based on price points, pickup and delivery time frames, and\n        other user requirements. Because each rate offered must be compliant\n        with the eBay shipping program, all rates reflect eBay-negotiated\n        prices. The various rates returned in a shipping quote offer the user a\n        choice from which they can choose a shipping service that best fits\n        their needs. Select the rate for your shipment and using the associated\n        rateId, call cerateFromShippingQuote to create a shipment and generate a\n        shipping label that you can use to ship the package.\n      operationId: createShippingQuote\n      requestBody:\n        description: The request object for createShippingQuote.\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              description: The request object for createShippingQuote.\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/ShippingQuoteRequest'\n        required: true\n      responses:\n        '201':\n          description: Created\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ShippingQuote'\n          x-response-codes:\n            errors:\n              '90135':\n                domain: API_LOGISTICS\n                category: REQUEST\n                description: \u003e-\n                  The provided shipTo address does not match the destination\n                  address of the order(s).\n        '400':\n          description: Bad Request\n          x-response-codes:\n            errors:\n              '90010':\n                domain: API_LOGISTICS\n                category: REQUEST\n                description: 'Missing field {fieldName}.'\n              '90020':\n                domain: API_LOGISTICS\n                category: REQUEST\n                description: 'Invalid field {fieldName}.'\n              '90110':\n                domain: API_LOGISTICS\n                category: REQUEST\n                description: 'The order {orderId} was not found on the platform.'\n        '409':\n          description: Conflict\n          x-response-codes:\n            errors:\n              '90100':\n                domain: API_LOGISTICS\n                category: REQUEST\n                description: No shipping services available for the provided addresses.\n              '90120':\n                domain: API_LOGISTICS\n                category: REQUEST\n                description: \u003e-\n                  The package specification is incompatible with the\n                  destination.\n              '90130':\n                domain: API_LOGISTICS\n                category: REQUEST\n                description: 'Order {orderId} is incompatible with our services.'\n              '90133':\n                domain: API_LOGISTICS\n                category: REQUEST\n                description: Maximum number of orders exceeded.
