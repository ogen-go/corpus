For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { \\\"bindings\\\": [ { \\\"role\\\": \\\"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\\\", \\\"members\\\": [ \\\"user:mike@example.com\\\", \\\"group:admins@example.com\\\", \\\"domain:google.com\\\", \\\"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\\\" ] }, { \\\"role\\\": \\\"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\\\", \\\"members\\\": [ \\\"user:eve@example.com\\\" ], \\\"condition\\\": { \\\"title\\\": \\\"expirable access\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\\\", \\\"expression\\\": \\\"request.time \u003c timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\\\", } } ], \\\"etag\\\": \\\"BwWWja0YfJA=\\\", \\\"version\\\": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time \u003c timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).\"\n      properties:\n        auditConfigs:\n          description: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.\n          items:\n            $ref: \"#/components/schemas/GoogleIamV1AuditConfig\"\n          type: array\n        bindings:\n          description: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.

The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.\n          items:\n            $ref: \"#/components/schemas/GoogleIamV1Binding\"\n          type: array\n        etag:\n          description: \"`etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.\"\n          format: byte\n          type: string\n        version:\n          description: \"Specifies the format of the policy.

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.
