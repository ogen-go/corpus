If the\n            orderIds parameter is included in the request, the filter parameter\n            will be ignored.The available criteria are as follows: creationdate\n            The time period during which qualifying orders were created (the\n            orders.creationDate field). In the URI, this is expressed as a\n            starting timestamp, with or without an ending timestamp (in\n            brackets).

The timestamps are in ISO 8601 format,\n            which uses the 24-hour Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) clock.For\n            example: lastmodifieddate:[2016-05-15T08:25:43.511Z..] identifies\n            orders modified on or after the given timestamp.\n            lastmodifieddate:[2016-05-15T08:25:43.511Z..2016-05-31T08:25:43.511\\\n            Z] identifies orders modified between the given timestamps,\n            inclusive.Note: If creationdate and lastmodifieddate are both\n            included, only creationdate is used. orderfulfillmentstatus The\n            degree to which qualifying orders have been shipped (the\n            orders.orderFulfillmentStatus field). In the URI, this is expressed\n            as one of the following value combinations:\n            orderfulfillmentstatus:{NOT_STARTED|IN_PROGRESS} specifies orders\n            for which no shipping fulfillments have been started, plus orders\n            for which at least one shipping fulfillment has been started but not\n            completed. orderfulfillmentstatus:{FULFILLED|IN_PROGRESS} specifies\n            orders for which all shipping fulfillments have been completed, plus\n            orders for which at least one shipping fulfillment has been started\n            but not completed.Note: The values NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, and\n            FULFILLED can be used in various combinations, but only the\n            combinations shown here are currently supported.Here is an example\n            of a getOrders call using all of these filters: GET\n            https://api.ebay.com/sell/v1/order?\n            filter=creationdate:%5B2016-03-21T08:25:43.511Z..2016-04-21T08:25:4\\\n            3.511Z%5D, lastmodifieddate:%5B2016-05-15T08:25:43.511Z..%5D,\n            orderfulfillmentstatus:%7BNOT_STARTED%7CIN_PROGRESS%7D Note: This\n            call requires that certain special characters in the URI query\n            string be percent-encoded: \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;[ = %5B\n            \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;] = %5D\n            \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;{ = %7B\n            \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;| = %7C\n            \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;} = %7D This query filter\n            example uses these codes.
