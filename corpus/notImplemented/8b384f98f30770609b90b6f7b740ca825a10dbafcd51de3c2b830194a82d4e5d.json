The 10-digit NHS number is used in England, Wales, the Isle of Man, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but not the Channel Islands. Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own distinct number ranges.\\n\\n### Access modes\\nThis API has three access modes:\\n\\n\\n| Access mode                    | End user authentication                             | Functions          | Availability |\\n| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |\\n| Application-restricted access  | None                                                | Search for a patient (single result).

Update own details (limited). | Available in integration environment (alpha)   |\\n\\n\\n## Who can use this API\\nThis API can only be used where there is a [legal basis](http://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/access-data-on-the-personal-demographics-service) to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development.  To do this, make a [PDS access request](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/access-data-on-the-personal-demographics-service). \\n\\nYou must do this before you can go live (see \\u2018Onboarding\\u2019 below).\\n\\n### Who can access PDS records\\nHealth and care organisations in England and the Isle of Man can access PDS records. Legitimate direct care examples include NHS organisations delivering healthcare, local authorities delivering care, third sector and private sector health and care organisations, and developers delivering systems to health and care organisations. \\n\\nHealth and care organisations in Wales access their own version of PDS called the Welsh Demographics Service (WDS) which is connected to PDS behind the scenes. \\n\\nHealth and care organisations in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands access their own equivalents of PDS.\\n\\nPatients who receive health and social care or make use of NHS services in England, Wales, the Isle of Man, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands.\\n\\n## Related APIs\\nThe following APIs also give access to the Personal Demographics Service:\\n- [Personal Demographics Service (SMSP) API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-smsp) - this API is now deprecated.\\n- [Personal Demographics Service (HL7 V3) API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-hl7-v3) - use this if you want to use functions that are not yet available on the FHIR API.\\n\\nOnce our roadmap is complete, the above APIs will become redundant.\\n\\nThe following APIs are also related to this API:\\n- [Personal Demographics Service Notifications - FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-notifications-fhir) - use this to subscribe to be notified of a limited set of patient record changes, such as birth, death, change of address and change of GP. If you would like to see this list expanded, please tell us about your use case and vote [here](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/suggestions/184902/pds-to-proactively-tell-a-gp-system-when-a-patient-record-is-updated)\\n- [Organisation Data Service FHIR API](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/ods/) - use this to get full details for the organisations related to the patient, such as their registered GP or nominated pharmacy.\\n\\n## API status and roadmap\\n### Application-restricted access\\nThis access mode is [stable](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status):\\n* you should strongly consider it as the primary choice for PDS integration\\n* we do not make routine breaking changes, if it cannot be avoided, for example, for security reasons, we will give advance notice\\n \\n### Healthcare worker access\\nThis access mode is in [beta](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status), meaning:\\n- it is available in production\\n- we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give advance notice\\n    \\n### Patient access\\nThis access mode is in [alpha](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status), meaning:\\n- it is available for testing in the integration environment, but not for production use\\n- we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give advance notice\\n\\n### Roadmap\\nTo see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?order=popular\u0026filter=allexceptdone\u0026tag=pds-fhir-api).\\n\\nIf you have any other queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).\\n\\n## Technology\\nThis API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).\\n\\nIt also conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange.\\nSpecifically, it is aligned with [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), which is built on FHIR Release 4.\\n\\nYou do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.\\nIn particular:\\n- resource names are capitalised and singular, for example `/Patient` not `/patients`\\n- array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines\\n- data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object\\n\\nThere are [libraries and SDKs available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.\\n\\n## Network access\\nThis API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).\\n\\nTo use this API with [NHS smartcards](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers) you do need an HSCN connection, although internet-facing alternatives are available.\\n\\nFor more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).\\n\\n## Security and authorisation\\n\\nRefer the table below to understand the recommended security pattern.

We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it\\u2019s worth planning well ahead.\\n\\n### New applications - after 9 December 2021\\nTo onboard for this API, follow our online [digital onboarding process](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/onboarding-process#digital-onboarding).\\n\\nTo get started, send us an email at [api.management@nhs.net](mailto:api.management@nhs.net).\\n\\n### In progress applications\\nIf your onboarding is already in progress, or we tell you that you're an exception, follow the [Supplier Conformance Assessment List (SCAL)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/onboarding-process#onboard-using-the-supplier-conformance-assessment-list-scal-process) process.\\n\\nWhen following the general SCAL process steps, for this API you must do the following:\\n\\nIn step 1, to confirm your use case, you need to [make a PDS access request](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/access-data-on-the-personal-demographics-service), even if you already access PDS via another method.\\n\\nIn step 2, when requesting the SCAL, tell us which access mode you're using:\\n- healthcare worker search and retrieve\\n- healthcare worker update\\n- application-restricted\\n- patient access\\n\\nIn step 2, if using healthcare worker access mode, tell us which security pattern you are using:\\n- NHS CIS2 - combined authentication and authorisation\\n- NHS CIS2 - separate authentication and authorisation\\n\\nIn step 2, if using patient access mode, tell us which security pattern you are using:\\n- NHS login - combined authentication and authorisation - available only upon request\\n- NHS login - separate authentication and authorisation\\n\\nIn step 6, when implementing your clinical risk management process, you must review and integrate the PDS FHIR API hazard log into your own risk log. It's embedded within the PDS FHIR API tab in the SCAL.\\n\\nIn step 8, you need to review and complete the PDS FHIR API risk log to show that you have understood and mitigated the various risks. You might be asked to provide some evidence to prove that controls have been put in place. You can find the risk log embedded within the PDS FHIR API tab in the SCAL. This is separate from the clinical safety hazard log mentioned above.\\n\\nIn step 9, you must conduct penetration testing to [CHECK standards](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/check-penetration-testing).\\n\\nIn step 10, when you complete the Service Desk Registration Form, send it to [api.management@nhs.net](mailto:api.management@nhs.net).\\n\\nIn step 11, submit your completed SCAL to [api.management@nhs.net](mailto:api.management@nhs.net).\\n\\nIn step 14, to request production access, contact us at [api.management@nhs.net](mailto:api.management@nhs.net).\\n\",\n        \"contact\": {\n            \"name\": \"Personal Demographics Service FHIR API Support\",\n            \"url\": \"https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support\",\n            \"email\": \"api.management@nhs.net\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"servers\": [\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/personal-demographics/FHIR/R4\",\n            \"description\": \"Sandbox environment.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/personal-demographics/FHIR/R4\",\n            \"description\": \"Integration test environment.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"https://api.service.nhs.uk/personal-demographics/FHIR/R4\",\n            \"description\": \"Production environment.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"paths\": {\n        \"/Patient\": {\n            \"parameters\": [\n                {\n                    \"$ref\": \"#/components/parameters/BearerAuthorization\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"$ref\": \"#/components/parameters/RoleId\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"$ref\": \"#/components/parameters/RequestID\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"$ref\": \"#/components/parameters/CorrelationID\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"get\": {\n                \"summary\": \"Search for a patient\",\n                \"operationId\": \"search-patient\",\n                \"externalDocs\": {\n                    \"description\": \"ODS codes and documentation.\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/ods-organization-code\"\n                },\n                \"description\": \"## Overview\\nUse this endpoint to search for a patient in PDS.\\n\\nYou can search using various combinations of:\\n  * given name\\n  * family name\\n  * gender\\n  * postcode\\n  * date of birth - which can be a range\\n  * date of death - which can be a range\\n  * registered GP practice\\n  \\nThere are various search options, such as fuzzy search, exact match, history and wildcards.\\n\\nThe behaviour of this endpoint depends on which access mode you are using:\\n\\n| Access mode                    | Behaviour                                  |\\n| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |\\n| Application-restricted access  | Only a single unique match returned        |\\n| Healthcare worker access       | Up to 50 matching patient records returned |\\n| Patient access                 | Not yet available                          |\\n\\n## Search options\\nThe following sections explain the various search options.\\nWhich options you choose depends very much on your use case, and getting it right is really important.\\nIf you need help, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).\\n\\n### Application-restricted access mode\\nIn this access mode, you only get a single matching patient record, and only if it's a unique match.\\n\\nUse search options that are likely to find a unique match. In our experience, the following is a good starting point:\\n  * search on given name, family name, postcode and date of birth - this combination should uniquely identify a patient\\n  * for given name, use the first three characters and a wildcard, for example to search for `Annabel`, use `Ann*` - this caters for different name spellings and abbreviations\\n  * for postcode, use the first two characters and a wildcard, for example to search for `LS11 6AD`, use `LS*` - this caters for people who have moved locally but not updated PDS\\n  * use a non-fuzzy search - this reduces the chance of multiple matches\\n  * use a non-exact match - an exact match does not work with wildcards\\n  * include history - this increases the chance of a match\\n\\nFor more details, see the following sections.\\n\\n### Healthcare worker access mode\\nIn this access mode - where the end user is a strongly authenticated healthcare worker - you can get up to 50 matching patient records.\\nThis allows the end user to choose the best match.\\n\\nUse search parameters that are relevant to your use case - for example date of death is not always appropriate.\\n\\nTo protect patient privacy, design your search to minimise the number of matching patients.\\nFor example, you could:\\n  * encourage users to enter as many search parameters as they can\\n  * force users to try a non-fuzzy search first and then only offer a fuzzy search if they cannot find the patient\\n\\nFor more details, see the following sections.\\n\\n### Non-fuzzy search\\nA non-fuzzy search:\\n  * allows wildcards in names and postcodes\\n  * does not match homophones or transposed names\\n  * can optionally search history, such as previous names and addresses\\n\\nIt is less likely to return multiple matches than a fuzzy search, so is more suitable for finding a unique match.\\n\\nThe minimum search parameters are:\\n  * family name - which can include wildcards\\n  * date of birth - which can be a range\\n  \\n### Fuzzy search\\nA fuzzy search:\\n  * matches common homophones, such as `Smith` and `Smythe`, using the [Soundex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex) algorithm\\n  * checks for transposed names, such as `Adam Thomas` and `Thomas Adam`\\n  * always searches history, such as previous names and addresses\\n\\nIt is more likely to include multiple matches than a non-fuzzy search, so is not ideal for finding a unique match.\\n\\nIt is also more likely to include false positives - other patients that match the search criteria.\\nTherefore, for privacy reasons, it is better to use it only if a non-fuzzy match has failed.\\n\\nYou must use one of the following search parameter combinations:\\n  * given name, family name and date of birth\\n  * family name, date of birth, gender and postcode\\n  * given name, date of birth, gender and postcode\\n\\nIf you include the date of death or registered GP practice query parameters, they are not used in the search. However they do affect the patient's matching score - a mismatch reduces the returned score.\\n\\n### History\\nPDS holds historic information, including previous names and addresses.\\n\\nA fuzzy search always includes history. For a non-fuzzy search, you can request to include history.\\n\\nSearching history can match patients where only a previous name or address is known, or if a patient provides a previous name or address on the assumption that their record hasn\\u2019t been updated.\\n\\n### Exact match\\nYou can request an exact match.\\nThis might be useful if you are verifying an NHS number against details you already believe to be correct.\\nIt is unlikely to work well with wildcards or fuzzy search.\\n\\n### Names\\nMatching names can be difficult due to:\\n  * multiple given names, such as in `Jane Anne Smith`\\n  * [compound given names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#Compound), such as in `John Paul Smith`\\n  * multiple or double-barrelled surnames, such as in `Michael Smith-Jones`\\n  * homophones, such as `Smith` and `Smythe` or `Ann` and `Anne`\\n  * abbreviated names, such as `Bob` instead of `Robert`\\n  * transposed names, such as `Adam Thomas` instead of `Thomas Adam`\\n  * previous names, such as maiden names\\n  * special characters such as in `O'Reilly`, `Jones-Smith` or `Koci\\u0144ski`\\n  * spelling mistakes, either in the search criteria or in PDS\\n\\nTo deal with some of these issues:\\n  * we always search all given names\\n  * we search across all types of name - usual, nickname and temporary\\n  * a fuzzy search matches homophones, transposed names and previous names\\n  * for a non fuzzy search, you can optionally use wildcards and search previous names\\n\\n### Gender\\nPDS has four options for gender - `male`, `female`, `other` and `unknown`.\\nFor some people, the gender held in PDS might not match the gender they identify with.\\n\\nIn these cases, searching by gender might not find the patient.\\nThese are edge cases but are important to consider because gender can be a sensitive issue for the people in question.\\n\\nIn general, we recommend not including gender as a search parameter.\\n  \\n### Date of birth and death\\nSometimes, the exact date of birth or death is not known when doing a search.\\nSometimes, the date of birth or death is not accurate in PDS.\\nFor example, if only the year of birth is known, the day and month of birth might be recorded as the first of January - for example, `01/01/1932`.\\n\\nIn such cases, searching a range of dates can help. This can result in multiple matches, so might not work well when searching for a unique match.\\n\\n### Postcode\\nPeople sometimes move locally, meaning the postcode in PDS is out of date, but does at least match on the first two characters.\\n\\nSearching for the first two characters of the postcode and a wildcard can work well. For example, to search for `LS11 6AD`, use `LS*`.\\nThis is only possible for a non-fuzzy search.\\n\\nThis can result in multiple matches, but it has been known to work well in some cases - even for unique matches.\\n\\n### General practitioner\\nThis is an ODS code. If you use it, it must match exactly.\\n\\n## Patient data returned\\nThe patient data returned on a search is not the full set of data that is returned on a retrieval by NHS number. The following data is included:\\n* NHS number\\n* names - usual, nickname and temporary\\n* gender\\n* birth information, apart from place of birth\\n* death information\\n* address - home address\\n* contact details\\n* registered GP\\n* restricted patient flag\\n\\nThe following data is excluded:\\n* place of birth\\n* names, apart from usual, nickname and temporary \\n* addresses, apart from home address\\n* pharmacy details\\n* communication details\\n* contact preferences\\n\\n### Restricted patients\\nSome patients are tagged as [restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/restricting-access-to-a-patients-demographic-record) and are sometimes known as sensitive patients. When performing a search, restricted patients can be returned; however, location sensitive fields such as `address`, `telecom`, `contact` and `generalPractitioner` are removed.\\n\\nIf `address-postcode` or `general-practitioner` are included in the search parameters, no restricted patients are returned even if a match is identified.\\n\\nThe restricted flag can be found in the data under `meta/security` on the patient resource.\\n\\n### Invalidated patients\\nSome patients are marked as invalidated in PDS - also known as `redacted` in FHIR terminology. Invalidated patient records are not returned in search results.\\nIf an invalidated patient record has been superseded, the superseding record is returned.\\n\\n## Scoring\\nEvery matched patient in the result list includes a score to indicate how closely the patient matched the search parameters.\\n\\nA score of 1.0 indicates an exact match. A score of less than 1.0 indicates a partial match.\\n\\nThe result list is sorted in descending score order - best match first.\\n\\nUse the `_exact-match` query parameter to return exact matches only - where the score is 1.0.\\n\\n## Clinical safety and privacy\\nThis endpoint can return multiple matching patients for a given search, including partial matches.\\n\\nEnsure that you design your software to minimise the following risks:\\n* an end user selects the wrong patient from the results presented, so there is a risk of clinical harm; for example due to retrieval of the wrong clinical data\\n* the end user has access to patients\\u2019 personal data, so there is a risk to patient privacy\\n\\nNote that:\\n* we record an access request in our audit trail for all patients matched in a PDS search\\n* it is almost certainly a good idea to display search results in descending score order - best match first\\n\\nPlease consider the information your application returns to users. For example a patient's temporary address can be used to perform a successful search. The home address will be included in the response. For citizen facing services please be aware of this behaviour and do not present a different address to the patient, unless they are logged in at a sufficiently high proof point.\\n\\n## Sandbox testing\\nYou can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment:\\n\\n| Scenario                    | Request                                                      | Response                                   |\\n| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |\\n| Basic search                | `family`=`Smith`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2010-10-22` | HTTP Status 200 with single search result. |\\n| Wildcard search             | `family`=`Sm*`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2010-10-22` | HTTP Status 200 with search result of two. |\\n| Search with limited results | `family`=`Sm*`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2010-10-22`, `_max-results`=`2` | HTTP Status 200 with search result of two. |\\n| Search with date range      | `family`=`Smith`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`ge2010-10-21`, `birthdate`=`le2010-10-23` | HTTP Status 200 with single search result. |\\n| Fuzzy search                | `family`=`Smith`, `given`=`Jane`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2010-10-22`, `_fuzzy-match`=`true` | HTTP Status 200 with single search result. |\\n| Restricted patient search   | `family`=`Smythe`, `given`=`Janet`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2005-06-16` | HTTP Status 200 with single search result with restricted data omitted. |\\n| Compound name search        | `family`=`Smith`, `given`=`John Paul`, `given`=`James`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2010-10-22` | HTTP Status 200 with single search result. |\\n| Unsuccessful search         | Any other valid search query parameters                      | HTTP Status 200 with no search results     |\\n| Invalid date format         | `birthdate` or `death-date` query parameters with values not in format `YYYY-MM-DD` | HTTP Status 400 with problem description   |\\n| Too few search parameters   | Any invalid combination of query parameters                  | HTTP Status 400 with problem description   |\\n| Missing X-Request-ID        | `id`=`9000000009` (or any other valid NHS number)            | HTTP Status 412 with problem description   |\\n\\nYou can try out the sandbox using the 'Try this API' feature on this page.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:\\n\\n\\n[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/a1ce1b055839caa384a8?action=collection%2Fimport)\\n\",\n                \"parameters\": [\n                    {\n                        \"$ref\": \"#/components/parameters/FuzzyMatch\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"$ref\": \"#/components/parameters/ExactMatch\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"$ref\": \"#/components/parameters/History\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"$ref\": \"#/components/parameters/MaxResults\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"$ref\": \"#/components/parameters/Family\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"$ref\": \"#/components/parameters/Given\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"$ref\": \"#/components/parameters/Gender\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"$ref\": \"#/components/parameters/Birthdate\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"$ref\": \"#/components/parameters/DeathDate\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"$ref\": \"#/components/parameters/AddressPostcode\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"$ref\": \"#/components/parameters/GeneralPractitioner\"\n                    }\n                ],\n                \"responses\": {\n                    \"200\": {\n                        \"description\": \"A completed search.

If an update takes longer than 10 seconds, the endpoint responds with an HTTP status of 503 (Gateway Timeout). \\n\\nYou can alter the timeout period using the `X-Sync-Wait` header. If you re-submit the update, use the same `X-Request-ID` header.\\n\\nThe behaviour of this endpoint depends on which access mode you are using:\\n\\n| Access mode                    | Behaviour restrictions              |\\n| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |\\n| Application-restricted access  | Updates not allowed                 |\\n| Healthcare worker access       | Updates allowed                     |\\n| Patient access                 | Updates allowed (Available in integration environment only)|\\n\\n## Patient resource versioning\\nTo update a patient's resource you must have retrieved it first, to ensure you are working against an up-to-date patient resource.\\n\\nWhen you retrieve a patient resource, you get a version number for the resource (in the `ETag` response header in the form `W/\\\"2\\\"` and in the `versionId` field in the response, in the form `\\\"2\\\"`).\\n\\nYou must then pass the patient's version number in the update request (in the `If-Match` response header).\\n\\nIt is recommended you use the value from the `Etag` header as this is in the correct form the `If-Match` header is expected, for example `W/\\\"2\\\"` and can be mirrored back in the request.\\n\\nThe update only succeeds, if the patient resource has not been updated in our database between your first retrieval and the update request.\\n\\nIf the update succeeds, you will receive the updated patient resource, this will contain the new resource version number.\\n\\nIf you make a subsequent update you must use the new version number.\\n\\n## JSON Patch\\nTo update a patient record, a [JSON Patch](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) should be sent. A JSON Patch consists of one or more patch objects within a list.\\n\\nIt is recommended that all desired updates are sent together in a single request as a list of patches.\\nThis is the most efficient approach and reduces the danger of race conditions occurring when updating the patient record multiple times in a short period of time.\\n\\nWhen processing the list of patch objects, each patch must be valid and pass all the business rules against the data. If one patch object fails, none of the patch objects are applied.\\n\\nA patch object consists of:\\n* an operation, `op` - this is required.\\n* a path to the data that you want to change, `path` - this is required.\\n* the value that is assigned, `value` - this is required for `add`, `replace` and `test`; but should not be included for a `remove`.\\n\\nThe following operations are supported:\\n* `add` - to add a new value.\\n* `replace` - to replace an existing value.\\n* `remove` - to remove an existing value.\\n* `test` - to test the state of a value is as expected before continuing with the update.\\n\\nPaths point to a single value, list or object, for example:\\n* `/gender` - pointing to the gender value.\\n* `/name` - point to the name list.\\n* `/name/0` - pointing to the 1st object in the name list.\\n* `/address/0/line/1` - pointing to the 2nd line string in the 1st address object.\\n\\nThe value can be set to any valid value for that path, so could be a null, a string, an object or a list.\\n\\n### Addition\\n\\n`add` should be used to add new items to a patient.\\n\\nAdding a simple data item such as the date of death can be done using a patch such as:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"patches\\\": [\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"add\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/deceasedDate\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"2020-01-01\\\" }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAdding to a list such as a `name` should be done by including the whole object in the value field. Note, the list index is `-` this is because when adding to a list, the index is not known:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"patches\\\": [\\n      {\\n            \\\"op\\\": \\\"add\\\",\\n            \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/-\\\",\\n            \\\"value\\\": {\\n                \\\"use\\\": \\\"usual\\\",\\n                \\\"period\\\": { \\\"start\\\": \\\"2019-12-31\\\" },\\n                \\\"prefix\\\": [\\\"Dr\\\"],\\n                \\\"given\\\": [\\n                  \\\"Joe\\\",\\n                  \\\"Horation\\\",\\n                  \\\"Maximus\\\"\\n                ],\\n                \\\"family\\\": \\\"Bloggs\\\",\\n                \\\"suffix\\\": [\\\"PhD\\\"]\\n            }\\n        }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhen adding a base level list item such as a new name or address, ensure the index is always `-`, otherwise the request is rejected. For example, `/name/-`.\\nThe reason for this is because the backend system makes the decision on the ordering of the listed objects to ensure they are always returned in the same order.\\n\\nIf you are adding to a sub-element that is a list, such as an additional given name, it is valid to provide an exact index. So the following is valid:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"patches\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"op\\\": \\\"add\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/0/id\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"8F8B957D\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"op\\\": \\\"add\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/0/given/0\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"Rose\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIt is possible to `add` a sub-element to an existing object in a patch request. If the object already exists and you have the object `id`, you must supply it or the update is rejected.\\nThe following patch is allowed:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"patches\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"op\\\": \\\"add\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/0/id\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"8F8B957D\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"op\\\": \\\"add\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/0/given/0\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"Rose\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nbut the following is not allowed:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"patches\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"op\\\": \\\"add\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/0/given/-\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"Rose\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Replacing\\n\\n`replace` should be used to alter existing items on the patient.\\n\\nReplacing a simple data item such as the gender can be done using a patch such as:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"patches\\\": [\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"replace\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/gender\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"male\\\" }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nReplacing a list item can be done in two ways which may be dependent on any external development libraries that can be used to create the patch.\\n\\nThe first approach is to replace the whole list item:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"patches\\\": [\\n      {\\n            \\\"op\\\": \\\"replace\\\",\\n            \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/0\\\",\\n            \\\"value\\\": {\\n                \\\"id\\\": \\\"123\\\",\\n                \\\"use\\\": \\\"usual\\\",\\n                \\\"period\\\": { \\\"start\\\": \\\"2019-12-31\\\" },\\n                \\\"prefix\\\": [\\\"Dr\\\"],\\n                \\\"given\\\": [\\n                  \\\"Joe\\\",\\n                  \\\"Horation\\\",\\n                  \\\"Maximus\\\"\\n                ],\\n                \\\"family\\\": \\\"Bloggs\\\",\\n                \\\"suffix\\\": [\\\"PhD\\\"]\\n            }\\n        }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe second approach is to replace just a part, or parts, of the list object keys if all others remain the same:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"patches\\\": [\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"replace\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/0/id\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"123\\\" },\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"replace\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/0/prefix/0\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"Mr\\\" },\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"replace\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/0/family\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"Smith\\\" }\\n    ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAn added requirement to ensure no accidental data loss or replacement of the wrong list item, you must always include the list `id` or `url`. This is in the object on retrieval so just needs to be mirrored back. You should not include an ID on an addition as this is automatically generated by the system and is a unique object ID, so only our system can guarantee that.\\n\\n### Removal\\n\\n`remove` should be used to delete existing items on a patient.\\n\\nRemoving a simple data item such as the gender can be done using a patch such as:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"patches\\\": [\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"remove\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/gender\\\" }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNote, that in this scenario, although the patch is perfectly valid, the update is still rejected as a patients gender cannot be removed.\\n\\nRemoving a list item should only be done on the whole item object, not individual sub-items; instead use the replace operation.\\n\\nTo remove a list item, a `test` operation must \u003cu\u003eimmediately proceed\u003c/u\u003e the `remove` . This is an added requirement to ensure no accidental data loss occurs or the wrong item is removed. The test operation should be used to assert either:\\n\\n* the `id` - the object ID for items that have one - for example `name`, `address` or `telecom`.\\n* the `url` - the URL for the extension being removed.\\n* the whole object being removed.\\n\\nAn example of a list item removal using the `id` would be:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"patches\\\": [\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"test\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/0/id\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"123\\\" },\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"remove\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/0\\\" }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAn example of a extension list item removal using the `url` would be:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"patches\\\": [\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"test\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/extension/0/url\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-DeathNotificationStatus\\\" },\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"remove\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/extension/0\\\" }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAn example of a list item removal using the whole object would be:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"patches\\\": [\\n      { \\n            \\\"op\\\": \\\"test\\\",\\n            \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/0\\\",\\n            \\\"value\\\": {\\n                \\\"id\\\": \\\"123\\\",\\n                \\\"use\\\": \\\"usual\\\",\\n                \\\"period\\\": { \\\"start\\\": \\\"2019-12-31\\\" },\\n                \\\"prefix\\\": [\\\"Dr\\\"],\\n                \\\"given\\\": [\\n                  \\\"Joe\\\",\\n                  \\\"Horation\\\",\\n                  \\\"Maximus\\\"\\n                ],\\n                \\\"family\\\": \\\"Bloggs\\\",\\n                \\\"suffix\\\": [\\\"PhD\\\"]\\n            }\\n        },\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"remove\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/0\\\" }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nSpecial care should be taken when performing multiple removals in the same list; as removing a particular index could affect all subsequent index positions. The next two examples perform **\u003cu\u003eexactly\u003c/u\u003e** the same operation.\\n\\nUsing the following initial (simplified) data, with the intention of removing the names in index 1 (Irwin) and 2 (Bruce):\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"name\\\": [\\n        {\\\"id\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"family\\\": \\\"Parker\\\"},\\n        {\\\"id\\\": \\\"3\\\", \\\"family\\\": \\\"Irwin\\\"},\\n        {\\\"id\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"family\\\": \\\"Bruce\\\"},\\n        {\\\"id\\\": \\\"5\\\", \\\"family\\\": \\\"Sharpe\\\"}\\n    ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Example 1**:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"patches\\\": [\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"test\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/1/id\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"3\\\" },\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"remove\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/1\\\" },\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"test\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/1/id\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"4\\\" },\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"remove\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/1\\\" }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAfter the 1st removal the data looks like:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"name\\\": [\\n        {\\\"id\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"family\\\": \\\"Parker\\\"},\\n        {\\\"id\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"family\\\": \\\"Bruce\\\"},\\n        {\\\"id\\\": \\\"5\\\", \\\"family\\\": \\\"Sharpe\\\"}\\n    ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nmeaning Irwin has been removed, Bruce has moved from index 2 -\u003e 1 and Sharpe from 3 -\u003e 2.\\n\\nSo after applying the 2nd removal the data looks like:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"name\\\": [\\n        {\\\"id\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"family\\\": \\\"Parker\\\"},\\n        {\\\"id\\\": \\\"5\\\", \\\"family\\\": \\\"Sharpe\\\"}\\n    ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhich is the intended outcome. Using the same index 1 for both removals may look unexpected, but the way JSON Patch works is iterating over each patch operation in turn and making the change to the list index positions. This means a developer needs to account for lists changing from one operation to the next.\\n\\n**Example 2**:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"patches\\\": [\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"test\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/2/id\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"4\\\" },\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"remove\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/2\\\" },\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"test\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/1/id\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"3\\\" },\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"remove\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/1\\\" }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAfter the 1st removal the data looks like:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"name\\\": [\\n        {\\\"id\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"family\\\": \\\"Parker\\\"},\\n        {\\\"id\\\": \\\"3\\\", \\\"family\\\": \\\"Irwin\\\"},\\n        {\\\"id\\\": \\\"5\\\", \\\"family\\\": \\\"Sharpe\\\"}\\n    ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nApplying the 2nd removal the data looks like:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"name\\\": [\\n        {\\\"id\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"family\\\": \\\"Parker\\\"},\\n        {\\\"id\\\": \\\"5\\\", \\\"family\\\": \\\"Sharpe\\\"}\\n    ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhich is the intended outcome. Providing the patches with the indexes descending means that the list stays in a stable format the whole way through as the only changes to the index positions are items have been passed over already.\\n\\n**Example 3 - a failure**\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"patches\\\": [\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"test\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/1/id\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"3\\\" },\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"remove\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/1\\\" },\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"test\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/2/id\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"4\\\" },\\n      { \\\"op\\\": \\\"remove\\\", \\\"path\\\": \\\"/name/2\\\" }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAfter the 1st removal the data looks like:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"name\\\": [\\n        {\\\"id\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"family\\\": \\\"Parker\\\"},\\n        {\\\"id\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"family\\\": \\\"Bruce\\\"},\\n        {\\\"id\\\": \\\"5\\\", \\\"family\\\": \\\"Sharpe\\\"}\\n    ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhen applying the 2nd test, it fails as the index 2 ID is `5`, but the test was looking for `4`. An error is returned and none of the updates provided would be made to the database.\\n\\nThis failure example is a good reason for forcing the use of the `test` operation. If there was no test, index 2 would have been blindly removed, meaning the final state of the data would look like:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"name\\\": [\\n        {\\\"id\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"family\\\": \\\"Parker\\\"},\\n        {\\\"id\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"family\\\": \\\"Bruce\\\"}\\n    ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhich is incorrect, as Irwin and Sharpe were removed instead of Irwin and Bruce.\\n\\n\\n## Patient data fields\\n\\n### Address\\n\\nList item found under `address` field.\\n\\nIn a JSON Patch request the path should be:\\n* `/address/0` if the address to be replaced or removed is the first item in the list. If it is the second item in the list the path is `/address/1`, and so on.\\n* `/address/-` when adding a new address.\\n\\nAn address consists of 5 lines of unstructured text, postcode and PAF (Postcode Address File) key.\\n\\nPostcode is optional but strongly encouraged.\\nIf the address has no postcode, use a [pseudo postcode from the list defined by the Office for National Statistics](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/organisation-data-service/data-downloads/office-for-national-statistics-data) (see the \\u2018look_ups\\u2019 file).\\n\\nIn particular, for a patient at no fixed abode, use the pseudo postcode `ZZ99 3VZ`.\\n\\nWhen adding or replacing address lines, use the following rules:\\n*\\tline 1 - premises ID and/or house name, for example `Flat 1` or `The Old Schoolhouse`\\n*\\tline 2 - house number, dependent thoroughfare name and descriptor (if present), thoroughfare name and descriptor, for example `23 Mill Lane`\\n*\\tline 3 - dependent locality/village, locality (if present), for example `Boxgrove`\\n*\\tline 4 - post town, for example `Leeds`\\n*\\tline 5 - county (if present), for example `West Yorkshire`\\n\\nWhen updating an address, you must populate lines 1 or 2, and line 4. You should not include line 5 in manually created addresses but you may include it in PAF-derived addresses.\\n\\nThere are exceptions:\\n* if you submit a postcode and PAF key, in which case the lines are automatically populated, however if there are no matches or too many matches the message is rejected due to missing address lines\\n* if you use a pseudo postcode, for example `ZZ99 3VZ` meaning `no fixed abode`\\n\\nWhen creating the FHIR payload message, to be fully FHIR compliant all empty lines should be removed, so for example:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"address\\\": {\\n        \\\"line\\\": [\\n            \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"23 Mill Lane\\\",\\n            \\\"\\\",\\n            \\\"Leeds\\\",\\n            \\\"\\\"\\n        ]\\n    }\\n\\n}\\n```\\n\\nshould be sent in as:\\n\\n```json\\n        {\\n            \\\"address\\\": {\\n                \\\"line\\\": [\\n                    \\\"23 Mill Lane\\\",\\n                    \\\"Leeds\\\"\\n                ]\\n            }\\n\\n        }\\n```\\n\\nhowever if you do not do this the message is not rejected; the response is in that form though.\\n\\nTo ensure consistent data across all patient addresses, you should match addresses to the PAF and send them in PAF format including the PAF key.\\nIf you do not include the PAF key it is added to the address if a match is found\\nAdditionally the provided address lines and post code are enriched and reformatted if necessary.\\n\\nThe following address types are supported:\\n* `home` - the home address is the patient's normal residence. Home address is also known as usual, main, registered, current or permanent address\\n* `temp` - a temporary address is an address used for a set period of time, but where the patient's home, permanent address remains unchanged\\n* `billing` - an address used for correspondence purposes only\\n\\nA patient must have no more than one current `temp` and/or `billing` address.\\nHowever, historically this was constrained only by the integration requirements and was not enforced so theoretically more than one can exist for a patient when retrieving.\\nWhere multiple instances already exist for the patient it is not expected that local systems should manage those, but should choose the most appropriate one to maintain (for example by examining period dates).\\n\\nA `home` address is the patient's main residential address and should normally be used for all clinical and demographic purposes, including clinical and appointment correspondence.\\nHowever additionally, `temp` and `billing` addresses may be provided by a patient when there is a requirement to record an alternative location for the purposes of unbroken care.\\nWhen sending correspondence to a patient:\\n*\\ta present and valid `billing` address may take precedence over `home` and `temp` addresses. A patient should have only a single current `billing` address. An address is considered 'valid' according to its period start and to dates.\\n*\\tif no current `billing` address is provided, a `temp` address may take precedence over the `home` address, again if it is valid according to its period start and to dates.\\n* if there is no valid, current `billing` and/or `temp` address, the `home` address must be used.\\n\\nNot all local systems support `temp` and `billing` addresses, so these are not uniformly maintained. Therefore, where the patient contact has clinical or business significance, the precedence of these addresses over the `home` address should be determined by a user wherever possible.\\nWhen the end date for a `temp` or `billing` address passes, local systems should use the patient\\u2019s `home` address. It is extremely rare that no home address is present on a patient record.\\n\\nBe aware of the following business rules:\\n* you cannot add more than one of each address use types; `home`, `temp` or `billing`\\n* `work` address `use` type is a valid response but cannot be added or replaced as it is a legacy value. An address with the `work` type can be removed though\\n* any `temp` address must have both a `period start` and a `period end` date. The provision of a period end date has particular importance in order to avoid temporary addresses that are no longer relevant to the patient still being held as current data available to any system retrieving the patient record. A suggested default where no actual period end is known is 30 days later than the period start, up to a maximum of 3 months.\\n* any `billing` address must have both a `period start` and a `period end` date. The provision of a period end date has particular importance in order to avoid correspondence addresses that are no longer relevant to the patient still being held as current data available to any system retrieving the patient record. A suggested default where no actual period end is known is 30 days later than the period start, up to a maximum of 12 months.\\n* the date period is optional; where present they must be valid dates and the `end` date cannot be before the `start` date\\n* the period `start` date is optional, however if provided cannot be a future date. If it is not provided it defaults to the date of update\\n* where a `temp` address is provided a description must be sent using the `text` field, the list of possible values are:\\n  * `Second Home` - a patient's second home\\n  * `Student Accommodation` - a patient's place of residence while at university\\n  * `Respite Care Address` - where the patient resides during respite care\\n  * `Temporary Residence Address` - where the patient resides for a specific period of time\\n  * `Convalescence Home` - the address for a patient during a period of recovery\\n  * `Mobile Home` - the address of a patient's mobile home, parked for a specific period of time, e.g. the address of a caravan park\\n  * `Holiday Home` - the address for a patient during a holiday\\n\\n### Communication\\n\\nSingle item found under `extension` with the extension URL `https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-NHSCommunication`.\\n\\nIn a JSON Patch request, where the communication extension does not exist the path should be:\\n* `/extension/-` when adding a communication extension.\\n\\nWhere you are replacing/removing the full communication extension, the path should be:\\n* `/extension/0` if the communication extension is the first item in the list.

meaning any business rules are not applied.\\n* You can use the patient with minimal data, `9000000033` to test adding all data types (as most of them are missing on this patient), that would normally be present (e.g. gender).\\n\\n| Scenario                            | Request                                                                   | Response                                         |\\n| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\\n| Successful update                   | `id`=`9000000009`\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eBody: One of the provided examples or your own combination of patches\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eHeaders: `If-Match`=`W/\\\"2\\\"`, `Content-Type`=`application/json-patch+json` | HTTP Status 200 with updated patient resource. |\\n| Patient does not exist               | `id`=`9111231130` (or any other valid NHS number)                         | HTTP Status 404 with problem description         |\\n| Invalid NHS number                  | `id`=`9000000000` (or any invalid NHS number)                             | HTTP Status 400 with problem description         |\\n| Missing resource version identifier | `If-Match` header missing or set to format other than `W/\\\"\u003cversion\u003e\\\"`     | HTTP Status 412 with problem description         |\\n| Incorrect resource version          | `If-Match`=`W/\\\"1\\\"`                                                        | HTTP Status 412 with problem description         |\\n| Wrong content type                  | `Content-Type` header missing or other than `application/json-patch+json` | HTTP Status 400 with problem description         |\\n| No patches sent                     | Send body with no `patches` attribute                                     | HTTP Status 400 with problem description         |\\n| Invalid patch operations            | Send body with invalid JSON patches in `patches` attribute                | HTTP Status 400 with problem description         |\\n| Missing X-Request-ID                | `id`=`9000000009` (or any other valid NHS number)                         | HTTP Status 412 with problem description         |\\n\\nYou can try out the sandbox using the 'Try this API' feature on this page.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:\\n\\n[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/14719036-953f067f-30b9-4552-8252-7cc10b21dad3)\\n\",\n                \"summary\": \"Update patient details\",\n                \"operationId\": \"update-patient-partial\",\n                \"externalDocs\": {\n                    \"description\": \"IETF RFC 6902, which defines json-patch.\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902\"\n                },\n                \"parameters\": [\n                    {\n                        \"$ref\": \"#/components/parameters/IfMatch\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"$ref\": \"#/components/parameters/ContentType\"\n                    }\n                ],\n                \"requestBody\": {\n                    \"required\": true,\n                    \"content\": {\n                        \"application/json-patch+json\": {\n                            \"schema\": {\n                                \"type\": \"object\",\n                                \"required\": [\n                                    \"patches\"\n                                ],\n                                \"properties\": {\n                                    \"patches\": {\n                                        \"type\": \"array\",\n                                        \"items\": {\n                                            \"type\": \"object\",\n                                            \"required\": [\n                                                \"op\",\n                                                \"path\"\n                                            ],\n                                            \"properties\": {\n                                                \"op\": {\n                                                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                                                    \"enum\": [\n                                                        \"remove\",\n                                                        \"add\",\n                                                        \"replace\",\n                                                        \"test\"\n                                                    ]\n                                                },\n                                                \"path\": {\n                                                    \"description\": \"The location of the information to remove, add or replace.

An address is considered 'valid' according to its period start and end dates.\\n  *\\tif no current `billing` address is provided, a `temp` address may take precedence over the `home` address, again if it is valid according to its period start and end dates.\\n  * if there is no valid, current `billing` and/or `temp` address, the `home` address must be used.\\n\",\n                                                        \"enum\": [\n                                                            \"home\",\n                                                            \"work\",\n                                                            \"temp\",\n                                                            \"billing\"\n                                                        ],\n                                                        \"example\": \"home\"\n                                                    },\n                                                    \"text\": {\n                                                        \"type\": \"string\",\n                                                        \"description\": \"Where a `temp` address is provided a descriptor text must be sent.\\nThe list of possible values are:\\n* `Second Home` - a patient's second home\\n* `Student Accommodation` - a patient's place of residence while at university\\n* `Respite Care Address` - where the patient resides during respite care\\n* `Temporary Residence Address` - where the patient resides for a specific period of time\\n* `Convalescence Home` - the address for a patient during a period of recovery\\n* `Mobile Home` - the address of a patient's mobile home, parked for a specific period of time, e.g. the address of a caravan park\\n* `Holiday Home` - the address for a patient during a holiday\\n\\nA patient can also register temporarily at a GP practice using a temporary address.
