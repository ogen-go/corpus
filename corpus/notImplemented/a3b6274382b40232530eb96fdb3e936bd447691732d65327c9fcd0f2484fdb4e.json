It is used to\n\n        specify access control policies for Cloud Platform resources.\n\n\n\n        A `Policy` consists of a list of `bindings`. A `binding` binds a list of\n\n        `members` to a `role`, where the members can be user accounts, Google groups,\n\n        Google domains, and service accounts. A `role` is a named list of permissions\n\n        defined by IAM.\n\n\n        **JSON Example**\n\n            {\n              \"bindings\": [\n                {\n                  \"role\": \"roles/owner\",\n                  \"members\": [\n                    \"user:mike@example.com\",\n                    \"group:admins@example.com\",\n                    \"domain:google.com\",\n                    \"serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\"\n                  ]\n                },\n                {\n                  \"role\": \"roles/viewer\",\n                  \"members\": [\"user:sean@example.com\"]\n                }\n              ]\n            }\n\n        **YAML Example**\n\n            bindings:\n            - members:\n              - user:mike@example.com\n              - group:admins@example.com\n              - domain:google.com\n              - serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\n              role: roles/owner\n            - members:\n              - user:sean@example.com\n              role: roles/viewer\n\n\n        For a description of IAM and its features, see the\n\n        [IAM developer's guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs).\n      properties:\n        auditConfigs:\n          description: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.\n          items:\n            $ref: \"#/components/schemas/AuditConfig\"\n          type: array\n        bindings:\n          description: |-\n            Associates a list of `members` to a `role`.\n            `bindings` with no members will result in an error.\n          items:\n            $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Binding\"\n          type: array\n        etag:\n          description: \u003e-\n            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help\n\n            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.\n\n            It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the\n\n            read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race\n\n            conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and\n\n            systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to\n\n            ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.\n\n\n            If no `etag` is provided in the call to `setIamPolicy`, then the existing\n\n            policy is overwritten.\n          format: byte\n          type: string\n        version:\n          description: \u003e-\n            Specifies the format of the policy.\n\n\n            Valid values are 0, 1, and 3.
