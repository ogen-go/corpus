FactSet's consensus estimates\n    are aggregated from a wide base of over 800+ contributors and cover over\n    19,000 active companies across 90+ countries. Data returned can be accessed\n    on the data frequencies based on quarterly, fiscal years, and calendar\n    years. FactSet Estimates updates on a real time basis intraday (every 5\n    minutes). Updating times vary based on earning season vs. non-earning season\n    but the goal is to have the data available to the client within a few hours\n    that FactSet receives updated information. Often times updates times can be\n    much faster as FactSet has always been known as one of the fastest estimate\n    providers in the market.\nservers:\n  - url: https://api.factset.com/content\n    description: Production\nsecurity:\n  - FactSetApiKey: []\n  - FactSetOAuth2: []\ntags:\n  - name: Consensus\n    description: \u003e-\n      The consensus or nest of all Estimates items aggregated by a statistic\n      such as mean or median.\n  - name: Broker Detail\n    description: \u003e-\n      The Broker-Level detail of Estimates items.
