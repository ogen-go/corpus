A `binding` binds a list of `members` to a `role`, where the members can be user accounts, Google groups, Google domains, and service accounts. A `role` is a named list of permissions defined by IAM.\n\n\n        **JSON Example**\n\n\n        { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/owner\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles/viewer\", \"members\": [\"user:sean@example.com\"] } ] }\n\n\n        **YAML Example**\n\n\n        bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/owner - members: - user:sean@example.com role: roles/viewer\n\n\n\n\n        For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM developer's guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs).\n      properties:\n        auditConfigs:\n          description: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.\n          items:\n            $ref: \"#/components/schemas/AuditConfig\"\n          type: array\n        bindings:\n          description: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. `bindings` with no\n            members will result in an error.\n          items:\n            $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Binding\"\n          type: array\n        etag:\n          description: \u003e-\n            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help\n            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each\n            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`\n            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to\n            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to\n            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the\n            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be\n            applied to the same version of the policy.\n\n\n            If no `etag` is provided in the call to `setIamPolicy`, then the existing policy is overwritten blindly.\n          format: byte\n          type: string\n        iamOwned:\n          description: \"\"\n          type: boolean\n        rules:\n          description: \"If more than one rule is specified, the rules are applied in the\n            following manner: - All matching LOG rules are always applied. - If\n            any DENY/DENY_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is denied.
