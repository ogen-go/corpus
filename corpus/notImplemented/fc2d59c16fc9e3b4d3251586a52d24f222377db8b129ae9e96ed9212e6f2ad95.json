A `Policy` is a collection of\n        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single\n        `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups,\n        and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each\n        `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some\n        types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`,\n        which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the\n        expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes\n        of the request, the resource, or both.
