A comma-separated list of paths, relative to `Environment`,\n          of fields to update. For example, to set the version of scikit-learn to\n          install in the environment to 0.19.0 and to remove an existing installation\n          of argparse, the `updateMask` parameter would include the following two\n          `paths` values: \"config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.scikit-learn\" and \"config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.argparse\".\n          The included patch environment would specify the scikit-learn version as\n          follows: { \"config\":{ \"softwareConfig\":{ \"pypiPackages\":{ \"scikit-learn\":\"==0.19.0\"\n          } } } } Note that in the above example, any existing PyPI packages other\n          than scikit-learn and argparse will be unaffected. Only one update type\n          may be included in a single request''s `updateMask`. For example, one cannot\n          update both the PyPI packages and labels in the same request. However, it\n          is possible to update multiple members of a map field simultaneously in\n          the same request. For example, to set the labels \"label1\" and \"label2\" while\n          clearing \"label3\" (assuming it already exists), one can provide the paths\n          \"labels.label1\", \"labels.label2\", and \"labels.label3\" and populate the patch\n          environment as follows: { \"labels\":{ \"label1\":\"new-label1-value\" \"label2\":\"new-label2-value\"\n          } } Note that in the above example, any existing labels that are not included\n          in the `updateMask` will be unaffected. It is also possible to replace an\n          entire map field by providing the map field''s path in the `updateMask`.\n          The new value of the field will be that which is provided in the patch environment.\n          For example, to delete all pre-existing user-specified PyPI packages and\n          install botocore at version 1.7.14, the `updateMask` would contain the path\n          \"config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages\", and the patch environment would be\n          the following: { \"config\":{ \"softwareConfig\":{ \"pypiPackages\":{ \"botocore\":\"==1.7.14\"\n          } } } } **Note:** Only the following fields can be updated: * `config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages`\n          * Replace all custom custom PyPI packages. If a replacement package map\n          is not included in `environment`, all custom PyPI packages are cleared.\n          It is an error to provide both this mask and a mask specifying an individual\n          package. * `config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.`packagename * Update the\n          custom PyPI package *packagename*, preserving other packages.

It is an error to provide\n          both a mask of this form and the `config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages` mask.\n          * `labels` * Replace all environment labels. If a replacement labels map\n          is not included in `environment`, all labels are cleared.

Refer to `SoftwareConfig.image_version` for\n          information on how to format the new image version. Additionally, the new\n          image version cannot effect a version downgrade and must match the current\n          image version''s Composer major version and Airflow major and minor versions.\n          Consult the [Cloud Composer Version List](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/concepts/versioning/composer-versions)\n          for valid values. * `config.softwareConfig.schedulerCount` * Horizontally\n          scale the number of schedulers in Airflow.
