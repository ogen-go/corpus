LDIF is a JSON format with a very simple structure described in the following sections. All mapping and processing of the incoming and outgoing data is done using \"Data Processors\" that are configured behind the API. Configuration of the processors can be done using the UI, please see the [Setup](https://docs-eas.leanix.net/docs/setup) page for more information. The configurations can be managed using the Integration API as well.\n  x-ballerina-init-description: \u003e\n    The connector initialization requires setting the API credentials.\n\n    Create a [LeanIX Account](https://www.leanix.net/en/) and obtain tokens following [this guide](https://docs-eas.leanix.net/docs/authentication).\n  x-ballerina-display:\n    label: Leanix Integration\n    iconPath: \"icon.png\"\nservers:\n- url: https://eu.leanix.net/services/integration-api/v1\n- url: https://us.leanix.net/services/integration-api/v1\nsecurity:\n- token: []\ntags:\n- name: examples\n- name: configurations\n- name: synchronizationRuns\npaths:\n  /examples/starterExample:\n    get:\n      tags:\n      -
