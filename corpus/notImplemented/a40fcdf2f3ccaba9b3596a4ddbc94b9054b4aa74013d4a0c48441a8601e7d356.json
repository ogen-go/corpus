If you specify a category ID that has child nodes, eBay returns policy information for all the leaf categories of that parent node. Example: filter=categoryIds:{100|101|102} Note that you must URL-encode the list of category ID values, which results in the following filter for the above example: \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;filter=categoryIds%3A%7B100%7C101%7C102%7D\",\n            \"required\": false,\n            \"schema\": {\n              \"type\": \"string\"\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"name\": \"marketplace_id\",\n            \"in\": \"path\",\n            \"description\": \"This path parameter specifies the eBay marketplace for which policy information is retrieved.
