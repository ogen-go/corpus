Each accounting document is transferred in a multipart object as a single file with optional metadata (document type and note). The content-type indicated in the multipart object has to correspond to the file. The accepted content-types and the accepted file size are determined by Belege online. Exception: ZIP files are not supported.\n\n        It is recommended that the user chooses the document type for each accounting document, as the document type affects further processing by DATEV. The chosen document type has to be existent at the given client. Please check the list of document types for a given client. The user should also have the possibility to choose “no document type”. \n\n        If the value of the document_type is empty, then the parameter will be ignored and will not be returned in the response. In this case, and if the parameter document_type is not used, the term “ohne Belegtyp” (without document type) is displayed in the DATEV applications.\n\n        **Please note:** \n        It is recommended that file names are encoded in UTF8. Unicode characters have to be precomposed characters; in other words, each special character, such as an umlaut (ä, ü, ö), has to be a single code point. Decomposed characters are not supported. This applies to both the file name and the metadata.\n\n        Large files require more storage space and can slow down load times within DATEV Unternehmen online and the DATEV Rechnungswesen-Programm. We recommend that the user is informed whenever the file size exceeds 500 kB.\n         \n        **Example:Document has been imported successfully:**\n         \n\n        ```json\n        HTTP/1.1 201 Processed\n        Content-Encoding: gzip\n        Transfer-Encoding: chunked\n\n        {\n        \"files\":[{\n        \"name\":\"Test-File.pdf\",\n        \"size\":\"125742\"\n        }],\n        \"document_type\":\"Rechnungseingang\",\n        \"note\":\"Beleg von Beispiel GmbH\"\n        }\n\n        ```\n      parameters:\n        - name: client-id\n          description: ID that identifies the client.\n          in: path\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n      responses:\n        '201':\n          description: Request OK; the document has been imported successfully.\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                type: object\n                properties:\n                  id:\n                    type: string\n                    description: ID of document\n                    example: BF00CD5C-0FE9-D106-5EC7-BA4FCF4A3951\n                  files:\n                    type: array\n                    description: file information on the document (read-only)\n                    items:\n                      type: object\n                      properties:\n                        id:\n                          type: string\n                          description: ID of the file of the document\n                          example: BF00CD5C-0FE9-D106-5EC7-BA4FCF4A3951\n                        name:\n                          type: string\n                          description: name of the file of the document\n                          example: Testrechnung-Eingang.pdf\n                        size:\n                          type: integer\n                          description: file size in bytes\n                          example: 300\n                        upload_date:\n                          type: string\n                          format: date-time\n                          description: import time  in accordance with ISO8601 „YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss±hh:mm“\n                          example: 2016-03-02T16:26:30.000+0000\n                        media_type:\n                          type: string\n                          description: Internet media type of the file\n                          example: application/pdf\n                    readOnly: true\n                  document_type:\n                    type: string\n                    description: document type of a document\n                    example: Rechnungseingang\n                  note:\n                    type: string\n                    description: note pertaining to the document for the tax consultant\n                    example: This is a sample note.\n        '400':\n          description: \"| Error, Error_description  | Description  | Example  | \\n|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|\\n| \\t#DCO01004 restapi.MultipartUploadFault | The third-party solution has transmitted an incorrect request.

The content-type indicated in the multipart object has to correspond to the file. The accepted content-types and the accepted file size are determined by Belege online. Exception: ZIP files are not supported.\n\n        It is recommended that the user chooses the document type for each accounting document, as the document type affects further processing by DATEV. The chosen document type has to be existent at the given client. Please check the list of document types for a given client. The user should also have the possibility to choose “no document type”.\n\n        If the value of document_type is empty, then the parameter will be ignored and will not be returned in the response. In this case, and if the parameter document_type is not used, the term “ohne Belegtyp” (without document type) is displayed in the DATEV applications.\n\n        **Please note:** \n        It is recommended that file names are encoded in UTF8. Unicode characters have to be precomposed characters; in other words, each special character, such as an umlaut (ä, ü, ö), has to be a single code point. Decomposed characters are not supported. This applies to both the file name and the metadata.\n\n        Large files require more storage space and can slow down load times within DATEV Unternehmen online and the DATEV Rechnungswesen-Programm. We recommend that the user is informed whenever the file size exceeds 500 kB.\n\n\n        **Example: Document has been imported succesfully:**\n\n\n        ```json\n        HTTP/1.1 201 Processed\n        Content-Encoding: gzip\n        Transfer-Encoding: chunked\n\n        {\n        \"files\":[{\n        \"name\":\"Test-File.pdf\",\n        \"size\":\"125742\"\n        }],\n        \"document_type\":\"Rechnungseingang\",\n        \"note\":\"Beleg von Beispiel GmbH\"\n        }\n\n        ```\n      parameters:\n        - name: client-id\n          description: ID that identifies the client.\n          in: path\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - name: document-id\n          description: ID that identifies the document.\n          in: path\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n            format: guid\n      responses:\n        '201':\n          description: Request OK; the document has been imported successfully.\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                type: object\n                properties:\n                  id:\n                    type: string\n                    description: ID of document\n                    example: BF00CD5C-0FE9-D106-5EC7-BA4FCF4A3951\n                  files:\n                    type: array\n                    description: file information on the document (read-only)\n                    items:\n                      type: object\n                      properties:\n                        id:\n                          type: string\n                          description: ID of the file of the document\n                          example: BF00CD5C-0FE9-D106-5EC7-BA4FCF4A3951\n                        name:\n                          type: string\n                          description: name of the file of the document\n                          example: Testrechnung-Eingang.pdf\n                        size:\n                          type: integer\n                          description: file size in bytes\n                          example: 300\n                        upload_date:\n                          type: string\n                          format: date-time\n                          description: import time  in accordance with ISO8601 „YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss±hh:mm“\n                          example: 2016-03-02T16:26:30.000+0000\n                        media_type:\n                          type: string\n                          description: Internet media type of the file\n                          example: application/pdf\n                    readOnly: true\n                  document_type:\n                    type: string\n                    description: document type of a document\n                    example: Rechnungseingang\n                  note:\n                    type: string\n                    description: note pertaining to the document for the tax consultant\n                    example: This is a sample note.\n        '400':\n          description: |-\n            | Error, Error_description  | Description  | Example  | \n            |-----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------| \n            | #DCO01004 restapi.MultipartUploadFault | The third-party solution has transmitted an incorrect request.
