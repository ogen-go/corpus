HERE Tracking also includes end-user applications on mobile and web to be used as reference apps to demonstrate the product capabilities.\n  license:\n    name: HERE Documentation License\n    url: https://legal.here.com/en-gb/terms/documentation-license\n  title: HERE Tracking\n  version: 2.0.0\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    - location\n  x-document-meta-data:\n    copyright: Â© 2019 HERE Europe B.V.\n    date-created: 2019-03-04T11:12:01+00:00\n    document-id: e2b7c7f-1551697845-e02e8ec4\n  x-logo:\n    url: https://twitter.com/HERE/profile_image?size=original\n  x-origin:\n    - format: swagger\n      url: https://developer.here.com/documentation/tracking/swagger/2.0/api_reference/swagger.json\n      version: \"2.0\"\n  x-providerName: here.com\n  x-serviceName: tracking\ntags:\n  - description: |\n      Manage associations between devices and other resources.\n    name: Device Associations\n  - description: \u003e\n      This service is used to manage the associations between devices and\n      geofences.\n\n\n      HERE Tracking generates a notification when a device crosses into or out of an associated geofence.\n    name: Geofence association\n  - description: \u003e\n      Create and manage geofences.\n\n\n      A geofence is a geographic boundary that you can define and associate with your\n\n      devices.

The channel supported for notifications is webhook.\n\n\n      Webhook\n\n      ---\n\n\n      Once a user has registered a URL as a webhook, that URL will receive a POST request\n\n      every time a transition happens.\n\n\n      The POST body is a JSON object that describes the transition.\n\n\n      ```\n\n      {\n          \"inOut\": \"PING_OUTSIDE_FENCE\",\n          \"fenceId\": \"{ID of geofence}\",\n          \"deviceId\": \"{ID of device that transitioned}\",\n          \"timestamp\": 1499258184142,\n          \"notificationStatus\": \"SENT\"\n      }\n\n      ```\n\n\n      Possible values for `inOut` are:\n\n       * PING_OUTSIDE_FENCE\n       * PING_IN_FENCE\n\n       Offline\n       ---\n\n       If a device has been working offline and caching position updates, transition\n       notifications aren't sent until the device is online again. Once the device is\n       online, the user receives a notification for the latest transition only.\n\n       This behavior prevents the user from receiving a batch of out-of-date notifications\n       whenever their device goes back online. However, all transitions are still recorded\n       in the transitions log.\n    name: Notifications\n  - description: \u003e\n      The Registry is used to create credentials for a device manufacturer and\n      for a claiming a device to a user.\n    name: Registry\n  - description: \u003e\n      Shadows provide an effective way to manage configurations for devices that\n      are only\n\n      intermittently online.\n\n\n      Shadows are stored in HERE Tracking and contain two states of a device's\n\n      configuration: The `reported` state and the `desired` state.\n\n\n      The `reported` state contains the settings that were sent when the device was last\n\n      online.\n\n\n      The `desired` state contains the settings that will be sent to the device when the\n\n      device next comes online.\n\n\n      \u003e **IMPORTANT**\n\n      \u003e Devices should not communicate directly with this service but should instead send telemetry\n\n      \u003e to the ingestion endpoint only.

These events are stored in the transition log.\n\n\n      This log also includes details of events where a device 'almost' crossed a geofence\n\n      boundary. Device positions determined through GPS, WiFi or other methods have a range\n\n      of uncertainty about them. This uncertainty is represented as a radius around the\n\n      recorded point showing the accuracy of the position.\n\n\n      These are times when the accuracy radius reported around a device interesects with\n\n      the geofence boundary but where it is not possible to confirm what side of the\n\n      geofence boundary the device is on. This returns those events as well as total transitions.\n    name: Transitions\n  - description: \u003e\n      Use this service to manage users, groups and roles for the other HERE\n      Tracking services.\n    name: Users\npaths:\n  /device-associations/v2/health:\n    get:\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: |\n            OK\n\n            The service is performing as expected\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                example:\n                  message: healthy\n                properties:\n                  message:\n                    description: Health status\n                    type: string\n                type: object\n        \"500\":\n          description: |\n            Service unavailable\n\n            The service is not performing as expected\n      security: []\n      summary: Gets service health\n      tags:\n        - Device Associations\n  /device-associations/v2/version:\n    get:\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: |\n            OK\n\n            Service returns its current version number\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                example:\n                  servicename: 1.0.0\n                properties:\n                  service-name:\n                    description: Version of service\n                    type: string\n                type: object\n        \"500\":\n          description: |\n            Service unavailable\n\n            The service is not performing as expected\n      security: []\n      summary: Gets service version\n      tags:\n        - Device Associations\n  \"/device-associations/v2/{trackingId}/geofences\":\n    get:\n      description: Returns all fences tracking id has been associated with\n      parameters:\n        - description: \u003e\n            ID used for correlating requests within HERE Tracking.

The\n        signature method uses the OAuth 1.0 standard. For more information on\n        this standard, see the [OAuth Core 1.0](https://oauth.net/core/1.0/)\n        specification.\n\n\n        \u003e **Note:** You must create a new signature for each token request to HERE Tracking. Signatures can only be used once.\n\n\n        Create the Signature Base String\n\n        ---\n\n\n        The first step in creating a signature is to create the signature base string. This string contains the parameters to use when generating the signature.\n\n\n        *1. To begin, make sure you have the information listed in the following table.*\n\n\n        | Parameter                | Description                              |\n\n        | ------------------------ | -----------------------------------------|\n\n        | oauth\\_consumer\\_key     | The device ID for which you want to generate a token. |\n\n        | oauth\\_signature\\_method | Always use \"HMAC-SHA256\".                 |\n\n        | oauth\\_timestamp         | The number of seconds since the Unix epoch at the point the request is generated. This must be within 10 seconds of the timestamp returned by the `/v2/timestamp` endpoint. |\n\n        | oauth\\_nonce             | A unique string for this signature. The string cannot have been used in a previous signature. Each token generation request to HERE Tracking must have a unique signature, and the value in this parameter is what is used to ensure the signature is unique. |\n\n        | oauth\\_version           | Always use \"1.0\".                         |\n\n\n        *2. Combine these values into a single string by following these steps:*\n\n           1. URL encode every key and value.\n           2. Sort the list of key-value pairs alphabetically by key.\n           3. Concatenate each key/value pair, separating each with an ampersand character (\"\u0026\").\n\n        The result is a parameter string that looks like this (line breaks are added for legibility):\n\n           ```\n           oauth_consumer_key=47164fb0-b7b3-49e8-891b-650270b82cf2\n           \u0026oauth_nonce=LIIpk4\n           \u0026oauth_signature_method=HMAC-SHA256\n           \u0026oauth_timestamp=1513634609\n           \u0026oauth_version=1.0\n           ```\n\n        *3. Combine the HTTP method, base URL, and parameter string into a single string called the \"base string\". This will be the string from which the signature is generated. The base string is in this format:*\n\n           ```\n           POST\u0026https://tracking.api.here.com/v2/token\u0026\u003cURL encoded parameter string\u003e\n           ```\n\n           The base string consists of:\n\n           1. The HTTP method in caps (POST) followed by an ampersand (\"\u0026\")\n           2. The URL of the HERE Tracking token endpoint followed by an ampersand (\"\u0026\")\n           3. The URL-encoded parameter string.\n\n           For example (line breaks are added for legibility):\n\n           ```\n           POST\n            \u0026https%3A%2F%2Ftracking.api.here.com%2Fv2%2Ftoken\n            \u0026oauth_consumer_key%3D47164fb0-b7b3-49e8-891b-650270b82cf2%26\n            oauth_nonce%3DLIIpk4%26oauth_signature_method%3DHMAC-SHA256%26\n            oauth_timestamp%3D1513634609%26oauth_version%3D1.0\n           ```\n\n           \u003e **Note:** The URL-encoded base string should contain exactly two ampersands (\"\u0026\").\n\n        Create the signature\n\n        ---\n\n\n        The signing key used to sign the base string is the `deviceSecret` followed by an ampersand (\"\u0026\").\n\n\n        Create the signature by passing the signature base string and the signing key to the `HMAC-SHA256` hashing algorithm and converting the result to a `base64` string. Then, use the signature to request a token.\n\n\n        Request the token\n\n        ---\n\n\n        Make a `POST` request to this endpoint with an `Authorization` header constructed from the above parameters and the generated signature.\n\n\n        Example:\n\n\n        ```\n            Authorization: OAuth oauth_consumer_key=\"47164fb0-b7b3-49e8-891b-650270b82cf2\",\n                oauth_signature_method=\"HMAC-SHA256\",\n                oauth_timestamp=\"1513634609\",\n                oauth_nonce=\"LIIpk4\",\n                oauth_version=\"1.0\",\n                oauth_signature=\"pQ9EJX14L736B%2Br7uZl4yQlO6Xw%3D\"\n        ```\n      in: header\n      name: Authorization\n      type: apiKey\n  schemas:\n    circle:\n      allOf:\n        - $ref: \"#/components/schemas/geofence\"\n        - properties:\n            definition:\n              description: An object that defines the area of the geofence.\n              properties:\n                center:\n                  description: The coordinates of the center point of the circle.\n                  properties:\n                    lat:\n                      description: Latitude in WGS-84 format, decimal representation\n                        ranging from -90 to 90.\n                      maximum: 90\n                      minimum: -90\n                      type: number\n                    lng:\n                      description: Longitude in WGS-84 format, decimal representation\n                        ranging from -180 to 180.\n                      maximum: 180\n                      minimum: -180\n                      type: number\n                  required:\n                    - lat\n                    - lng\n                  type: object\n                radius:\n                  description: The radius of the circle in meters.\n                  minimum: 0\n                  type: number\n              required:\n                - center\n                - radius\n              type: object\n          type: object\n      description: A circular geofence\n      type: object\n    claimedDevice:\n      additionalProperties: false\n      example:\n        trackingId: HERE-6da0f871-b4eb-4800-90e6-4bae86a788d6\n      properties:\n        trackingId:\n          description: The ID HERE Tracking assigned to the device when it was claimed by a\n            user.\n          type: string\n      required:\n        - trackingId\n      type: object\n    country:\n      description: Indicates in which country the WLAN APs are located (in case cell data\n        is not present in radio_observations)\n      properties:\n        mcc:\n          description: Mobile Country Code\n          maximum: 999\n          minimum: 200\n          type: integer\n      required:\n        - mcc\n      type: object\n    d4975492c92aa17c81b3dc25375e2436a957120b0e33c1ed44a316ce21d8ef08:\n      discriminator:\n        propertyName: type\n      example:\n        definition:\n          center:\n            lat: 52.5308398\n            lng: 13.38490035\n          radius: 100\n        description: An area in berlin\n        name: Berlin Office\n        type: circle\n      properties:\n        definition:\n          type: object\n        description:\n          description: A description of the area that the geofence encloses and the purpose\n            of the geofence.\n          type: string\n        name:\n          description: A human-readable name for the geofence.\n          type: string\n        type:\n          description: The type of geofence shape.
