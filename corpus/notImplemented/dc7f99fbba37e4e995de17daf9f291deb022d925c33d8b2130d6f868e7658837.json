The `public_key_id`\n\n        DOES NOT validate or authenticate a public key; it only provides a mechanism\n\n        for quickly selecting a public key ALREADY CONFIGURED on the verifier through\n\n        a trusted channel. Verification implementations MUST reject signatures in any\n\n        of the following circumstances:\n          * The `public_key_id` is not recognized by the verifier.\n          * The public key that `public_key_id` refers to does not verify the\n            signature with respect to the payload.\n\n        The `signature` contents SHOULD NOT be \"attached\" (where the payload is\n\n        included with the serialized `signature` bytes). Verifiers MUST ignore any\n\n        \"attached\" payload and only verify signatures with respect to explicitly\n\n        provided payload (e.g. a `payload` field on the proto message that holds\n\n        this Signature, or the canonical serialization of the proto message that\n\n        holds this signature).\n      properties:\n        publicKeyId:\n          description: \u003e-\n            The identifier for the public key that verifies this signature.\n              * The `public_key_id` is required.\n              * The `public_key_id` MUST be an RFC3986 conformant URI.\n              * When possible, the `public_key_id` SHOULD be an immutable reference,\n                such as a cryptographic digest.\n\n            Examples of valid `public_key_id`s:\n\n\n            OpenPGP V4 public key fingerprint:\n              * \"openpgp4fpr:74FAF3B861BDA0870C7B6DEF607E48D2A663AEEA\"\n            See https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/openpgp4fpr for more\n\n            details on this scheme.\n\n\n            RFC6920 digest-named SubjectPublicKeyInfo (digest of the DER\n\n            serialization):\n              * \"ni:///sha-256;cD9o9Cq6LG3jD0iKXqEi_vdjJGecm_iXkbqVoScViaU\"\n              * \"nih:///sha-256;703f68f42aba2c6de30f488a5ea122fef76324679c9bf89791ba95a1271589a5\"\n          type: string\n        signature:\n          description: \u003e-\n            The content of the signature, an opaque bytestring.\n\n            The payload that this signature verifies MUST be unambiguously provided\n\n            with the Signature during verification.
