During\n            patching, a VM is considered disrupted from the time the agent is notified\n            to begin until patching has completed. This disruption time includes the\n            time to complete reboot and any post-patch steps. A VM contributes to\n            the disruption budget if its patching operation fails either when applying\n            the patches, running pre or post patch steps, or if it fails to respond\n            with a success notification before timing out. VMs that are not running\n            or do not have an active agent do not count toward this disruption budget.\n            For zone-by-zone rollouts, if the disruption budget in a zone is exceeded,\n            the patch job stops, because continuing to the next zone requires completion\n            of the patch process in the previous zone. For example, if the disruption\n            budget has a fixed value of `10`, and 8 VMs fail to patch in the current\n            zone, the patch job continues to patch 2 VMs at a time until the zone\n            is completed. When that zone is completed successfully, patching begins\n            with 10 VMs at a time in the next zone. If 10 VMs in the next zone fail\n            to patch, the patch job stops.\n        mode:\n          description: Mode of the patch rollout.\n          enum:\n          - MODE_UNSPECIFIED\n          - ZONE_BY_ZONE\n          - CONCURRENT_ZONES\n          type: string\n      type: object\n    RecurringSchedule:\n      description: Sets the time for recurring patch deployments.\n      properties:\n        endTime:\n          description: Optional.
