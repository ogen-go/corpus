Tripping the rate\n    limit will result in a 503 response.\n\n\n    The autocomplete API also has an additional rate limit.\n\n\n    If you expect to breach the limit please [contact\n    us](https:ideal-postcodes.co.uk/support) and we can move you to an endpoint\n    with a higher limit.\n\n\n    ### JSONP\n\n\n    [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) requests are supported. Include\n    a `callback=` in your request as a query parameter. Your results return\n    wrapped in a function designated by your request.\n\n\n    ## Authentication\n\n\n    Most requests require an **API key** for authentication. Authenticate by\n    passing an `api_key` as part of the query string. For example:\n\n\n    ```\n\n    api.ideal-postcodes.co.uk/v1/postcodes/ID11QD?api_key=iddqd\n\n    ```\n\n\n    Alternatively, authentication can be transmitted via the `Authorization`\n    header using the following scheme:\n\n\n    ```\n\n    Authorization: IDEALPOSTCODES api_key=\"iddqd\" [other_key=\"foo\"]\n\n    ```\n\n\n    ## Versioning\n\n\n    This API is versioned with a simple prefix in the URL. The current version\n    is `/v1/`. We will maintain backwards-compatibility by releasing breaking\n    changes under a new version.\n\n\n    Please note that the following changes are backwards-compatible:\n\n\n    - Adding new properties to existing API responses\n\n    - Adding new API endpoints\n\n    - Adding new optional request parameters to existing API endpoints\n\n    - Changing the order of properties in existing API responses\n\n    - Changing the autocomplete address suggestion format\n\n\n    ## Error Handling\n\n\n    A successful lookup is accompanied with a HTTP status code of 200 and a\n    response code of 2000 (found in the body).\n\n\n    An error has occurred if the HTTP status code is not 200. Errors can range\n    from a benign 404 (resource not found) to more urgent errors (your API Key\n    ran out of credit, failed authentication, etc).\n\n\n    ## Testing\n\n\n    Each method has a simple testing procedure available which does not affect\n    your account balance. You can find these methods\n    [here](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk/documentation/testing).\n\n\n    ### Community Key\n\n\n    Our documentation and demos make heavy use of our community key `iddqd`.\n    This allows for convenient access for trialing the API.\n\n\n    Many restrictions on this key are relaxed to allow developers make test\n    requests. This key has a limit of 15 lookups per IP address per day as well\n    as a daily usage cap. If you hit any limit restrictions, you can continue\n    testing the API by creating a key of your own and using our free test\n    methods.\n\n\n    Please be kind with the community key. We're trusting everyone to use it\n    responsibly so that other developers may trial the API. Thank you!\n\n\n    ## Metadata\n\n\n    Requests that affect your balance may be annotated with arbitrary metadata.\n    This data is stored along with your lookup history and can be queried at a\n    later date via the API or the dashboard. We call the ability to label your\n    requests [tagging](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk/documentation/metadata).\n\n\n    # Response Codes\n\n\n    The API returns two indicators to help you to determine the status of each\n    HTTP request.\n\n\n    The first is the **HTTP Status**, which is found in the status-line of all\n    HTTP requests. The API will return status codes that adhere to HTTP /1.1\n    Specifications wherever possible.\n\n\n    `2XX` status codes indicates success while `4XX` and `5XX` indicate client\n    and server errors respectively.\n\n\n    The second is the **API response code**, which can be found in the `code`\n    property of the response body. This code will provide a more specific reason\n    if a failure has occurred and can point you in the right direction when\n    debugging.\n\n\n    Please use the glossary of code numbers and HTTP status codes below when\n    debugging your requests.\n\n\n    ## 200 Request Success\n\n\n    | HTTP Code | API Code | Description                                  |\n\n    | --------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n\n    | 200       | 2000     | Success.

Postcode searches\n        are space and case insensitive.\n\n\n        The Postcode Lookup API provides a JSON interface to search UK addresses\n        from a postcode. It can be used to power Postcode Lookup driven address\n        searches, like [Postcode Lookup](/postcode-lookup).\n\n\n        ## JavaScript Example\n\n\n        ```javascript\n\n        const { Client, postcodes } = require(\"@ideal-postcodes/core-node\");\n\n\n        const api_key = \"iddqd\";\n\n\n        const client = new Client({ api_key: \"iddqd\" });\n\n\n        await postcodes.retrieve(client, \"ID1 1QD\", { query: { api_key } });\n\n        ```\n\n\n        This API models postcodes as a HTTP resource. The above example provides\n        a thin JavaScript abstraction and more control over the HTTP request and\n        response. The JavaScript client also provides a number of terser helper\n        methods like\n        [`client.lookupPostcode`](https://github.com/ideal-postcodes/core-interface#lookup-a-postcode)\n\n\n        If you wish to quickly add Postcode Lookup driven address finder on your\n        page, see our [Postcode Lookup plugin](/postcode-lookup) and [associated\n        demos](/postcode-lookup-demo).\n\n\n        [JavaScript client method\n        documentation](https://github.com/ideal-postcodes/core-interface#lookup-a-postcode)\n\n\n        ## Postcode Not Found\n\n\n        Lookup balance is unaffected by invalid postcodes. The API returns a\n        `404` response with response body:\n\n\n        ```json\n\n        {\n          \"code\": 4040,\n          \"message\": \"Postcode not found\",\n          \"suggestions\": [\"SW1A 0AA\"]\n        }\n\n        ```\n\n\n        ### Suggestions\n\n\n        If a postcode cannot be found, the API will provide up to 5 closest\n        matching postcodes. Common errors will be corrected first (e.g. mixing\n        up `O` and `0` or `I` and `1`).\n\n\n        If the suggestion list is small (fewer than 3), there is a high\n        probability the correct postcode is there. You may notify the user or\n        immediately trigger new searches.\n\n\n        The suggestion list will be empty if the postcode has deviated too far\n        from a valid postcode format.\n\n\n        ## Multiple Residence\n\n\n        A small number of  postcodes will return more than 100 premises.

Retrieve partial address suggestions via `/autocomplete/addresses`\n\n        2. Retrieve the entire address by following the URL provided by the\n        suggestion\n\n\n        Step 2 will decrement your lookup balance.\n\n\n        Please note, this API is not intended to be a free standalone resource.\n\n\n        ### JavaScript Example\n\n\n        #### Step 1. Retrieve a list of suggestions\n\n\n        ```javascript\n\n        const { Client, autocomplete } = require(\"@ideal-postcodes/core-node\");\n\n\n        const response = await autocomplete.list(client, {\n          query: {\n            query: \"221b bake\",\n            api_key: \"iddqd\",\n          },\n        });\n\n        ```\n\n\n        #### Step 2. Resolve a suggestion retrieved above for a full address\n\n\n        ```javascript\n\n        const { lookupUdprn } = require(\"@ideal-postcodes/core-node\");\n\n\n        const udprn = 17646242;\n\n\n        await lookupUdprn({ client, udprn });\n\n        ```\n\n\n        ## Filters\n\n\n        You can strictly narrow your result by adding filters to your\n        querystring which correspond with an address attribute.\n\n\n        For instance, you can restrict to postcode `SW1A 2AA` by appending\n        `postcode=sw1a2aa`.\n\n\n        If a filter term is invalid, e.g. `postcode=SW1A2AAA`, then an empty\n        result set is returned and no lookup is incurred.\n\n\n        You can also scope using multiple terms for the same filter with a comma\n        separated list of terms. E.g. Restrict results to E1, E2 and E3 outward\n        codes: `postcode_outward=e1,e2,e3`. Multiple terms are\n        \u003ccode\u003eOR\u003c/code\u003e'ed, i.e. the matching result sets are combined.\n\n\n        All filters can accept multiple terms unless stated otherwise below.\n\n\n        Multiple filters can also be combined. E.g. Restrict results to small\n        user organisations in the N postcode area:\n        `su_organisation_indicator=Y\u0026postcode_area=n`. Multiple filters are\n        \u003ccode\u003eAND\u003c/code\u003e'ed, i.e. each additional filter narrows the result set.\n\n\n        A maximum of **10** terms are allowed across all filters.\n\n\n        ## Biases\n\n\n        You can boost certain addresses results that correspond with a certain\n        address attribute. All bias searches are prefixed with `bias_`.\n\n\n        Biased searches, unlike filtered searches, also allow unmatched\n        addresses to appear. These will rank lower.\n\n\n        For instance, can boost addresses with postcode areas `SW` and `SE` by\n        appending `bias_postcode_area=SW,SE`.\n\n\n        No bias effect applies to bias terms that are invalid. \n\n        e.g. `bias_postcode=SW1A2AAA` \n\n\n        You may scope using multiple terms for the same bias with a comma\n        separated list of terms. E.g. Restrict results to `E1`, `E2` and `E3`\n        outward codes: \u003ccode\u003ebias_postcode_outward=e1,e2,e3\u003c/code\u003e.\n\n\n        All biases can accept multiple terms unless stated otherwise below.\n\n\n        A combined maximum of **5** terms are allowed across all biases.\n\n\n        [JavaScript client method\n        documentation](https://github.com/ideal-postcodes/core-interface#lookup-a-postcode)\n\n\n        ## Suggestion Format\n\n\n        The suggestion format is prone to change over time. Attempts to parse\n        the suggestion may result in your integration breaking. Instead use the\n        suggestion as-is.\n\n\n        ## Querying with a Postcode\n\n\n        - If a postcode is passed as a query, all addresses for that postcode\n        will be listed as the result if the limit parameter is not supplied\n\n        - If a postcode forms only part of the query, your autocomplete results\n        will be filtered by that postcode\n\n\n        ## Querying Multiple Residence\n\n\n        For Multiple Residence enabled keys, any Multiple Residence households\n        will also return a UMPRN id. This can be retrieved with the `/umprn/:id`\n        endpoint. \n\n        Note that Multiple Residence households will always have:\n\n        - A parent premise with a UDPRN\n\n        - A single UDPRN premise may have many Multiple Residence households\n        with different UMPRNs.\n\n\n        ## Rate Limiting\n\n\n        You can make up to 3000 requests to the autocomplete API within a 5\n        minute span. The HTTP Header contains information on your current rate\n        limit.\n\n\n        | Header                  |\n        Description                                                                           \n        |\n\n        | ----------------------- |\n        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        |\n\n        | `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | The maximum number of requests that can be\n        made in 5 minutes                           |\n\n        | `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The remaining requests within the current\n        rate limit window                            |\n\n        | `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | The time when the rate limit window resets\n        in Unix Time (seconds) or UTC Epoch seconds |\n\n\n        ## Pricing\n\n\n        This API currently does not affect your balance. However, subsequent\n        searches require a paid request (e.g. a UDPRN search). This paid\n        request, will yield the complete address.\n\n\n        Please note, this API is not intended as a standalone free resource.\n        Integrations that consistently make autocomplete requests without a paid\n        request to resolve an address may be disrupted via tightened rate\n        limits. Continued misuse will result in account suspension.\n\n\n        ## Testing\n\n\n        `ID1 1QD` will return address suggestions, that when retrieved via\n        `/udprn/:id` will not affect your balance.\n      operationId: AddressAutocomplete\n      parameters:\n        - name: api_key\n          in: query\n          style: form\n          required: true\n          explode: false\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ApiKeyParam'\n        - name: query\n          in: query\n          description: \u003e-\n            Specifies the address you wish to query.

Addresses\n      summary: Extract Addresses\n      description: \u003e+\n        Extract a list of complete addresses that match the query ordered by\n        relevance score. This query accepts an optional limit and page query\n        (defaults to 10 and 0 respectively).\n\n\n        If a valid postcode is passed as the query string, the entire address\n        list for that postcode is passed as a result. Note, in these cases,\n        limit and page parameters are ignored.\n\n\n        This API is designed as a multi-purpose tool for generating address\n        lists, cleansing and wholesale data extraction according to specific\n        parameters. \n\n\n        For address finder, see our address finder API - which is designed for\n        speed and ergonomics.\n\n\n        ### JavaScript Example\n\n\n        ```javascript\n\n        const { Client, lookupAddress } = require(\"@ideal-postcodes/core-node\");\n\n\n        const client = new Client({ api_key: \"iddqd\" });\n\n\n        await lookupAddress({ client, query: \"10 Brompton Rd\" });\n\n        ```\n\n\n        [JavaScript client method\n        documentation](https://github.com/ideal-postcodes/core-interface#search-for-an-address)\n\n\n        ## Filters\n\n\n        You can strictly narrow your result by adding filters to your query\n        string which correspond with an address attribute.\n\n\n        For instance, you can restrict to postcode `SW1A 2AA` by appending\n        `postcode=sw1a2aa`.\n\n\n        If a filter term is invalid, e.g. `postcode=SW1A2AAA`, then an empty\n        result set is returned and no lookup is incurred.\n\n\n        You can also scope using multiple terms for the same filter with a comma\n        separated list of terms. E.g. Restrict results to E1, E2 and E3 outward\n        codes: `postcode_outward=e1,e2,e3`. Multiple terms are `OR`'ed, i.e. the\n        matching result sets are combined.\n\n\n        All filters can accept multiple terms unless stated otherwise below.\n\n\n        Multiple filters can also be combined. E.g. Restrict results to small\n        user organisations in the N postcode area:\n        `su_organisation_indicator=Y\u0026postcode_area=n`. Multiple filters are\n        `AND`'ed, i.e. each additional filter narrows the result set.\n\n\n        A combined maximum of 5 terms are allowed across all filters.\n\n\n        ## Biases\n\n\n        You can boost certain addresses results that correspond with a certain\n        address attribute. All bias searches are prefixed with `bias_`.\n\n\n        Biased searches, unlike filtered searches, also allow unmatched\n        addresses to appear . These will rank lower.\n\n\n        For instance, you can boost addresses with postcode areas `SW` and `SE`\n        by appending `bias_postcode_area=SW,SE`.\n\n\n        If a bias term is invalid, e.g. `bias_postcode=SW1A2AAA` no bias effect\n        is applied.\n\n\n        You may scope using multiple terms for the same bias with a comma\n        separated list of terms. E.g. Restrict results to `E1`, `E2` and `E3`\n        outward codes: `bias_postcode_outward=e1,e2,e3`.\n\n\n        All biases can accept multiple terms unless stated otherwise below.\n\n\n        A combined maximum of 5 terms are allowed across all biases.\n\n\n        ## Search by Postcode and Building Name or Number\n\n\n        Search by postcode and building attribute with the postcode filter and\n        query argument. E.g. For \"SW1A 2AA Prime Minister\"\n        `/v1/addresses?postcode=sw1a2aa\u0026q=prime minister`.\n\n\n        The advantage of using filters is a postcode mismatch does not result in\n        a lookup as no results are returned.\n\n\n        #### Search By UPRN\n\n\n        Search by UPRN using the `uprn` filter and excluding the query argument.\n        E.g. `/v1/addresses?uprn=100`.\n\n\n        ## Testing\n\n\n        - **ID1 1QD** Returns a successful query response `2000`\n\n        - **ID1 KFA** Returns an empty query response `2000`\n\n        - **ID1 CLIP** Returns \"no lookups remaining\" error `4020`\n\n        - **ID1 CHOP** Returns \"daily (or individual) lookup limit breached\"\n        error `4021`\n\n\n        Test request undergo the usual authentication and restriction rules.\n        This is to help surface any issues that occur during implementation and\n        does not cost you a lookup.\n\n      operationId: Addresses\n      parameters:\n        - name: api_key\n          in: query\n          style: form\n          required: true\n          explode: false\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ApiKeyParam'\n        - name: query\n          in: query\n          description: \u003e-\n            Specifies the address you wish to query.

These are\n        assigned to one single address either due to the large volume of mail\n        received at that address, or because a PO Box or Selectapost service has\n        been set up. Small User Postcodes. These identify a group of Delivery\n        Points. On average there are 15 Delivery Points per Postcode. However\n        this can vary between 1 and, in some cases, 100. There will never be\n        more than 100 Delivery Points on a Postcode.\n      example: S\n    SuOrganisationIndicator:\n      title: Small User Organisation Indicator\n      type: string\n      description: \u003e-\n        Small User Organisation Indicator can have the values 'Y' or space.
