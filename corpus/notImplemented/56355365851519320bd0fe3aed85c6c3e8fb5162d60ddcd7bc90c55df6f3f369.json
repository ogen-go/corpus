Overwrites\n\n        any existing policy.\n\n\n        The following constraints apply when using `setIamPolicy()`:\n\n\n        + Project does not support `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` as\n\n        `members` in a `Binding` of a `Policy`.\n\n\n        + The owner role can be granted to a `user`, `serviceAccount`, or a group\n\n        that is part of an organization. For example,\n\n        group@myownpersonaldomain.com could be added as an owner to a project in\n\n        the myownpersonaldomain.com organization, but not the examplepetstore.com\n\n        organization.\n\n\n        + Service accounts can be made owners of a project directly\n\n        without any restrictions. However, to be added as an owner, a user must be\n\n        invited via Cloud Platform console and must accept the invitation.\n\n\n        + A user cannot be granted the owner role using `setIamPolicy()`. The user\n\n        must be granted the owner role using the Cloud Platform Console and must\n\n        explicitly accept the invitation.\n\n\n        + You can only grant ownership of a project to a member by using the\n\n        GCP Console. Inviting a member will deliver an invitation email that\n\n        they must accept. An invitation email is not generated if you are\n\n        granting a role other than owner, or if both the member you are inviting\n\n        and the project are part of your organization.\n\n\n        + Membership changes that leave the project without any owners that have\n\n        accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) will be rejected.\n\n\n        + If the project is not part of an organization, there must be at least\n\n        one owner who has accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) agreement in the\n\n        policy. Calling `setIamPolicy()` to remove the last ToS-accepted owner\n\n        from the policy will fail. This restriction also applies to legacy\n\n        projects that no longer have owners who have accepted the ToS. Edits to\n\n        IAM policies will be rejected until the lack of a ToS-accepting owner is\n\n        rectified.\n\n\n        + This method will replace the existing policy, and cannot be used to\n\n        append additional IAM settings.\n\n\n        Note: Removing service accounts from policies or changing their roles\n\n        can render services completely inoperable. It is important to understand\n\n        how the service account is being used before removing or updating its\n\n        roles.\n\n\n        Authorization requires the Google IAM permission\n\n        `resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy` on the project\n      operationId: cloudresourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy\n      parameters:\n        - description: \u003e-\n            REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified.\n\n            See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field.\n          in: path\n          name: resource\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n      requestBody:\n        $ref: \"#/components/requestBodies/SetIamPolicyRequest\"\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: Successful response\n          content:\n            \"*/*\":\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Policy\"\n      security:\n        - Oauth2:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n          Oauth2c:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n      tags:\n        - projects\n  \"/v1/projects/{resource}:testIamPermissions\":\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/_.xgafv\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/access_token\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/alt\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/callback\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/fields\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/key\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/oauth_token\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/prettyPrint\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/quotaUser\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/uploadType\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/upload_protocol\"\n    post:\n      description: |-\n        Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified Project.\n\n        There are no permissions required for making this API call.\n      operationId: cloudresourcemanager.projects.testIamPermissions\n      parameters:\n        - description: \u003e-\n            REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being\n            requested.\n\n            See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field.\n          in: path\n          name: resource\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n      requestBody:\n        $ref: \"#/components/requestBodies/TestIamPermissionsRequest\"\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: Successful response\n          content:\n            \"*/*\":\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/TestIamPermissionsResponse\"\n      security:\n        - Oauth2:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n          Oauth2c:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n        - Oauth2:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform.read-only\n          Oauth2c:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform.read-only\n      tags:\n        - projects\n  \"/v1/{name}\":\n    delete:\n      description: \u003e-\n        Delete a Lien by `name`.\n\n\n        Callers of this method will require permission on the `parent` resource.\n\n        For example, a Lien with a `parent` of `projects/1234` requires permission\n\n        `resourcemanager.projects.updateLiens`.\n      operationId: cloudresourcemanager.liens.delete\n      parameters:\n        - description: The name/identifier of the Lien to delete.\n          in: path\n          name: name\n          required: true\n          x-reservedExpansion: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: Successful response\n          content:\n            \"*/*\":\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Empty\"\n      security:\n        - Oauth2:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n          Oauth2c:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n        - Oauth2:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform.read-only\n          Oauth2c:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform.read-only\n      tags:\n        - liens\n    get:\n      description: Fetches an Organization resource identified by the specified resource\n        name.\n      operationId: cloudresourcemanager.organizations.get\n      parameters:\n        - description: \u003e-\n            The resource name of the Organization to fetch.

This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes.\n\n        The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values.\n\n        The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only\n\n        if the value contains a \":\".

You can set `allowed_values` and\n\n        `denied_values` in the same `Policy` if `all_values` is\n\n        `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`. `ALLOW` or `DENY` are used to allow or deny all\n\n        values.

However, if `inherit_from_parent` is\n\n            set to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent\n\n            resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are\n\n            added to the values inherited up the hierarchy.\n\n\n            Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied\n\n            values isn't recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration\n\n            simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with\n\n            `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set.\n\n            In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and\n\n            not present in `denied_values`.\n\n\n            For example, suppose you have a `Constraint`\n\n            `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of\n\n            `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`.\n\n            Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that\n\n            restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a\n\n            `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has\n\n            `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY,\n\n            then an attempt to activate any API will be denied.\n\n\n            The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for\n\n            `projects/bar` parented by `organizations/foo`:\n\n\n            Example 1 (no inherited values):\n              `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:\n                {allowed_values: “E1” allowed_values:”E2”}\n              `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and values:\n                {allowed_values: \"E3\" allowed_values: \"E4\"}\n            The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.\n\n            The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`.\n\n\n            Example 2 (inherited values):\n              `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:\n                {allowed_values: “E1” allowed_values:”E2”}\n              `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values:\n                {value: “E3” value: ”E4” inherit_from_parent: true}\n            The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.\n\n            The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`.\n\n\n            Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values):\n              `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:\n                {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values: \"E2\"}\n              `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:\n                {denied_values: \"E1\"}\n            The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.\n\n            The value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`.\n\n\n            Example 4 (RestoreDefault):\n              `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:\n                {allowed_values: “E1” allowed_values:”E2”}\n              `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values:\n                {RestoreDefault: {}}\n            The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.\n\n            The accepted values at `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on\n\n            the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if\n\n            `DENY`, none).\n\n\n            Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy):\n              `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set.\n              `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set.\n            The accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on\n\n            the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if\n\n            `DENY`, none).\n\n\n            Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all):\n              `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:\n                {allowed_values: “E1” allowed_values: ”E2”}\n              `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:\n                {all: ALLOW}\n            The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`.\n\n            Any value is accepted at `projects/bar`.\n\n\n            Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none):\n              `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:\n                {allowed_values: “E1” allowed_values: ”E2”}\n              `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:\n                {all: DENY}\n            The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`.\n\n            No value is accepted at `projects/bar`.\n\n\n            Example 10 (allowed and denied subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy):\n\n            Given the following resource hierarchy\n              O1-\u003e{F1, F2}; F1-\u003e{P1}; F2-\u003e{P2, P3},\n              `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:\n                {allowed_values: \"under:organizations/O1\"}\n              `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:\n                {allowed_values: \"under:projects/P3\"}\n                {denied_values: \"under:folders/F2\"}\n            The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `organizations/O1`,\n              `folders/F1`, `folders/F2`, `projects/P1`, `projects/P2`,\n              `projects/P3`.\n            The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `organizations/O1`,\n              `folders/F1`, `projects/P1`.\n          type: boolean\n        suggestedValue:\n          description: \u003e-\n            Optional.
