You\n        should not request that a user give you an integration token if you\n        don’t meet these criteria.

You should suggest a description for this token - typically the name of your product or feature - and use it consistently for all users.\n\n\n        Self-issued access tokens currently grant the `basicProfile` and `publishPost` scope. A future iteration of the API will require a user to select the scope they wish to grant access to.\n\n\n        Self-issued access tokens do not expire, though they may be revoked by the user at any time.\n      in: header\n      name: Authorization\n      type: apiKey\n    OauthSecurity:\n      description: First you must register an application on Medium.
