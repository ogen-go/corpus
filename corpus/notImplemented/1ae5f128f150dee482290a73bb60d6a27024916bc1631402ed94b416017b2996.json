This must be an integer or a double value. If the field is not an integer or double, or if the field does not yet exist, the transformation will set the field to the given value. If either of the given value or the current field value are doubles, both values will be interpreted as doubles. Double arithmetic and representation of double values follow IEEE 754 semantics. If there is positive/negative integer overflow, the field is resolved to the largest magnitude positive/negative integer.\n        maximum:\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Value\"\n          description: Sets the field to the maximum of its current value and the given value. This must be an integer or a double value. If the field is not an integer or double, or if the field does not yet exist, the transformation will set the field to the given value. If a maximum operation is applied where the field and the input value are of mixed types (that is - one is an integer and one is a double) the field takes on the type of the larger operand. If the operands are equivalent (e.g. 3 and 3.0), the field does not change. 0, 0.0, and -0.0 are all zero. The maximum of a zero stored value and zero input value is always the stored value.

If a minimum operation is applied where the field and the input value are of mixed types (that is - one is an integer and one is a double) the field takes on the type of the smaller operand. If the operands are equivalent (e.g. 3 and 3.0), the field does not change. 0, 0.0, and -0.0 are all zero. The minimum of a zero stored value and zero input value is always the stored value.

Equivalent numbers of the different types (e.g. 3L and 3.0) are considered equal when deciding whether an element should be removed. NaN is equal to NaN, and Null is equal to Null.
