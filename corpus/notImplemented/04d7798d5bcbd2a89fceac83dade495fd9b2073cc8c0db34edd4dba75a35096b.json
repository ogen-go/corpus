A tax table entry for a jurisdiction is comprised of two fields: one for the jurisdiction's sales-tax rate and another that's a boolean value indicating whether or not shipping and handling are taxed in the jurisdiction. You can set up tax tables for countries that support different tax jurisdictions. Currently, only Canada, India, and the US support separate tax jurisdictions. If you sell into any of these countries, you can set up tax tables for any of the country's jurisdictions. Retrieve valid jurisdiction IDs using getSalesTaxJurisdictions in the Metadata API. For details on using this call, see Establishing sales-tax tables. Important! Starting in January 2019, eBay will begin to calculate, collect, and remit sales tax on behalf of sellers for items shipped to customers. This feature is rolling out on specific dates to specific US states as defined on the following page: eBay sales tax collection. Once eBay starts to collect sales tax for a state, no action is required on the seller's part and there will be no charges or fees for eBay automatically calculating, collecting and remitting sales tax. The sales-tax collection process will apply to all the sales in the states that support this feature, whether the seller is located in or outside of the United States. When a buyer purchases an item on eBay, and the ship-to address is one of the states where eBay collects the sales tax, eBay will calculate and add the applicable sales tax at checkout. The buyer will pay both the cost of the item along with the sales tax. eBay will collect and remit the tax.\"\n      operationId: createOrReplaceSalesTax\n      parameters:\n        - description: This path parameter specifies the two-letter ISO 3166 code for the country for which you want to create tax table entry.\n          in: path\n          name: countryCode\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: This path parameter specifies the ID of the sales-tax jurisdiction for the table entry you want to create.\n          in: path\n          name: jurisdictionId\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: \"#/components/schemas/SalesTaxBase\"\n              description: A container that describes the how the sales tax is calculated.\n        description: A container that describes the how the sales tax is calculated.\n        required: true\n      responses:\n        \"204\":\n          description: No Content\n        \"400\":\n          description: Bad Request\n          x-response-codes:\n            errors:\n              \"20400\":\n                category: REQUEST\n                description: Invalid request. {additionalInfo}\n                domain: API_ACCOUNT\n              \"20401\":\n                category: REQUEST\n                description: Missing field {fieldName}. {additionalInfo}\n                domain: API_ACCOUNT\n              \"20403\":\n                category: REQUEST\n                description: Invalid {fieldName}. {additionalInfo}\n                domain: API_ACCOUNT\n              \"20404\":\n                category: REQUEST\n                description: \"{fieldName} not found.\"\n                domain: API_ACCOUNT\n              \"20407\":\n                category: REQUEST\n                description: Tax table not supported for {fieldName}.\n                domain: API_ACCOUNT\n        \"404\":\n          description: Not Found\n        \"500\":\n          description: Internal Server Error\n          x-response-codes:\n            errors:\n              \"20500\":\n                category: APPLICATION\n                description: System error.\n                domain: API_ACCOUNT\n      security:\n        - api_auth:\n            - https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.account\n      tags:\n        - sales_tax\ncomponents:\n  schemas:\n    Amount:\n      description: A complex type that describes the value of a monetary amount as represented by a global currency.\n      properties:\n        currency:\n          description: \"The base currency applied to the value field to establish a monetary amount.

IMPORTANT: Extended Holiday Returns is a seasonally available feature that is offered on some eBay marketplaces. To see if the feature is enabled in any given year, check the Returns on eBay page before the holiday season begins. If the feature is not enabled for the season, this field is ignored. The extended holiday returns period is defined by three dates: The start date = start of November. The purchase cutoff date = end of the year. The end date = end of January. The above dates may vary by a few days each year. Sellers are notified of the current dates on their eBay marketplace before the holiday period starts. Sellers can specify Extended Holiday Returns (as well as their regular non-holiday returns period) for chosen listings at any time during the year. The Extended Holiday Returns offer is not visible in listings until the start date of current year's holiday returns period, at which point it overrides the non-holiday returns policy. Buyers can see the Extended Holiday Returns offer in listings displayed through the purchase cutoff date and are able to return those purchases until the end date of the period. After the purchase cutoff date, the Extended Holiday Returns offer automatically disappears from the listings and the seller's non-holiday returns period reappears. Purchases made from that point on are subject to the non-holiday returns period, while purchases made before the cutoff date still have until the end of the period to return under the program.
