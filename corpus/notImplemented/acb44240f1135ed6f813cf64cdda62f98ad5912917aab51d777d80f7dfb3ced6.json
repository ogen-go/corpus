A data source is a unique source of sensor data. Data\n        sources can expose raw data coming from hardware sensors on local or companion\n        devices. They can also expose derived data, created by transforming or merging\n        other data sources. Multiple data sources can exist for the same data type.\n        Every data point in every dataset inserted into or read from the Fitness API\n        has an associated data source. Each data source produces a unique stream of\n        dataset updates, with a unique data source identifier. Not all changes to\n        data source affect the data stream ID, so that data collected by updated versions\n        of the same application/device can still be considered to belong to the same\n        data source. Data sources are identified using a string generated by the server,\n        based on the contents of the source being created. The dataStreamId field\n        should not be set when invoking this method. It will be automatically generated\n        by the server with the correct format. If a dataStreamId is set, it must match\n        the format that the server would generate. This format is a combination of\n        some fields from the data source, and has a specific order. If it doesn't\n        match, the request will fail with an error.
