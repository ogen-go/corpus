Once your app has completed this flow, you will still need to call `POST /v2/token` in order to swap the code for a valid access token.\n      operationId: getAuthorizationPage\n      parameters:\n        - description: The client's ID\n          in: query\n          name: client_id\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: The client's URL to redirect to if the authentication is approved\n          in: query\n          name: redirect_uri\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: The type of response; currently, only `code` is supported\n          in: query\n          name: response_type\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n            enum:\n              - code\n        - description: A space-separated list of scope(s) requested by the application\n          in: query\n          name: scope\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: A CSRF token generated by the client, to be roundtripped through the\n            request for added security\n          in: query\n          name: state\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n      responses:\n        \"302\":\n          description: The correct parameters were passed in and we are redirecting to the\n            authentication page; OR, a valid `redirect_uri` was supplied but\n            there was another error, and the error type and message are embedded\n            in the querystring.\n          headers:\n            Location:\n              description: The sign-in page to redirect to; most clients will process this\n                redirect automatically.\n              schema:\n                type: string\n                format: url\n        \"400\":\n          description: A bad request; generally, one or more parameters passed in were\n            incorrect or missing.

If you are a third-party developer, you are also required to provide the `scope` parameter; see the documentation for `GET /v2/authorize` for possible values. `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.\n\n\n        For the `password` grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `username` and `password` parameters. The `code` and `redirect_uri` parameters are ignored.\n\n        Third-party developers do not have access to this grant type.\n\n\n        For the `refresh_token` grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `refresh_token` parameter. The `scope` parameter can optionally be used to request a different set of scopes than were used in the original request, but it **cannot** contain any scopes that were not previously requested. If not specified, then `scope` will be set to whichever scopes were used for the original access token request. If trading in an old non-expiring access token for a refresh-enabled token, set the value of `refresh_token` to the access token value and `token_type_hint` must be set to `access_token`. `code`, `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.\n\n\n        The `temporary_user` and `anonymous_user` grant types are custom grant types created by NPR to suit our needs for functionality such as our \u0026quot;try-before-you-buy\u0026quot; experience. If you are a third-party developer, you will not have access to these grant types unless we have explicitly given you permission within our system.\n\n        For these grant types, if you are a third-party developer, you are required to provide the `scope` parameter; see the documentation for `GET /v2/authorize` for possible values. `code`, `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.\n\n\n        The `third_party` grant type is another custom grant type created by NPR to handle login via third-party providers such as Facebook and Google. If you are a third-party developer, you will not have access to this grant types unless we have explicitly given you permission within our system.\n\n        For this grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `service` and `token` parameters. If you are a third-party developer, you are also required to provide the `scope` parameter; see the documentation for `GET /v2/authorize` for possible values. The `code` and `redirect_uri` parameters are ignored.\n\n\n        If you are unsure of which grant type to select, assume that `authorization_code` is the one you want.\n\n\n        Note that at this time, refresh tokens are an opt-in feature; however, in the future, they will gradually transition to being opt-out, and ultimately required for all clients. Our general guidance at this time is that if this endpoint starts returning refresh tokens for you, you are responsible for implementing the code to handle them appropriately in accordance with the OAuth 2.0 spec.
