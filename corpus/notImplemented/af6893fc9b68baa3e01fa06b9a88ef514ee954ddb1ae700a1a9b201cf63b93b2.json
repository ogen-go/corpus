A `Policy` is a collection of\n        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members\n        can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as\n        G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM\n        predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud\n        resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical\n        expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates\n        to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request,\n        the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their\n        IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).\n        **JSON example:** { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\",\n        \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\",\n        \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\":\n        \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\"\n        ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant\n        access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time \u003c timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'')\",\n        } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings:\n        - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com\n        - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\n        - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\n        condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after\n        Sep 2020 expression: request.time \u003c timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'')\n        etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see\n        the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).'\n      properties:\n        auditConfigs:\n          description: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.\n          items:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/AuditConfig'\n          type: array\n        bindings:\n          description: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`.
