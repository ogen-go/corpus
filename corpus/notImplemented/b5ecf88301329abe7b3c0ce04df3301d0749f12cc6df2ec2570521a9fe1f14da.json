A `Policy` is a collection of\n        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single\n        `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups,\n        and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each\n        `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some\n        types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`,\n        which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the\n        expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes\n        of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions\n        in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).\n        **JSON example:** { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\",\n        \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\",\n        \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\":\n        \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\"\n        ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant\n        access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time \u003c timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'')\",\n        } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings:\n        - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com\n        - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\n        - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\n        condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after\n        Sep 2020 expression: request.time \u003c timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'')\n        etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see\n        the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).'\n      properties:\n        auditConfigs:\n          description: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.\n          items:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/AuditConfig'\n          type: array\n        bindings:\n          description: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.\n            Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the\n            `bindings` are applied.

The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500 principals;\n            up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of\n            a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings`\n            grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other\n            principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings`\n            in the `Policy`.\n          items:\n            $ref: '#/components/schemas/Binding'\n          type: array\n        etag:\n          description: '`etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way\n            to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each\n            other.

If you omit this field,\n            then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`\n            policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.'\n          format: byte\n          type: string\n        version:\n          description: 'Specifies the format of the policy.

Any\n            operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version\n            `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a\n            policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional\n            role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy\n            * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy\n            that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you\n            must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you\n            omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy\n            with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3`\n            policy are lost.
