For example, `5,30` would show splits\n          of Tasks that were canceled or accepted before and after 5 seconds and before\n          and after 30 seconds. This can be used to show short abandoned Tasks or\n          Tasks that failed to meet an SLA. TaskRouter will calculate statistics on\n          up to 10,000 Tasks for any given threshold.\n        in: query\n        name: SplitByWaitTime\n        schema:\n          type: string\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/taskrouter.v1.workspace.workflow.workflow_cumulative_statistics'\n          description: OK\n      security:\n      - accountSid_authToken: []\n      x-maturity:\n      - GA\n    servers:\n    - url: https://taskrouter.twilio.com\n    x-twilio:\n      className: workflow_cumulative_statistics\n      defaultOutputProperties:\n      - start_time\n      - end_time\n      - avg_task_acceptance_time\n      - tasks_completed\n      parent: /Workspaces/{WorkspaceSid}/Workflows\n      pathType: instance\n  /v1/Workspaces/{WorkspaceSid}/Workflows/{WorkflowSid}/RealTimeStatistics:\n    description: 'TODO: Resource-level docs'\n    get:\n      description: ''\n      operationId: FetchWorkflowRealTimeStatistics\n      parameters:\n      - description: The SID of the Workspace with the Workflow to fetch.\n        in: path\n        name: WorkspaceSid\n        required: true\n        schema:\n          maxLength: 34\n          minLength: 34\n          pattern: ^WS[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$\n          type: string\n      - description: Returns the list of Tasks that are being controlled by the Workflow\n          with the specified SID value.\n        in: path\n        name: WorkflowSid\n        required: true\n        schema:\n          maxLength: 34\n          minLength: 34\n          pattern: ^WW[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$\n          type: string\n      - description: Only calculate real-time statistics on this TaskChannel.
