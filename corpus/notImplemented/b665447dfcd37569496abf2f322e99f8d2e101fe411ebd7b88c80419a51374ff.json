A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM\n        predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud\n        resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical\n        expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates\n        to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request,\n        the resource, or both.
