An example for such relationships is the\n\n        delegation of privileges or permissions.\n\n\n        This command is most often used by infrastructure systems to check\n\n        preconditions for an action.  For example, a client may want to know if it\n\n        is OK to send a web URL to a particular mobile app instead. The client can\n\n        check for the relevant asset link from the website to the mobile app to\n\n        decide if the operation should be allowed.\n\n\n        A note about security: if you specify a secure asset as the source, such as\n\n        an HTTPS website or an Android app, the API will ensure that any\n\n        statements used to generate the response have been made in a secure way by\n\n        the owner of that asset.  Conversely, if the source asset is an insecure\n\n        HTTP website (that is, the URL starts with `http://` instead of\n\n        `https://`), the API cannot verify its statements securely, and it is not\n\n        possible to ensure that the website's statements have not been altered by a\n\n        third party.
