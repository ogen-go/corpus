Given a context and featurized content, the Personalizer Service\n    returns your content in a ranked list. As rewards are sent in response to\n    the ranked list, the reinforcement learning algorithm will improve the model\n    and improve performance of future rank calls.\n  title: Personalizer Client\n  version: v1.0\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    -
