In addition to returning items, which is the default, you can return refinements (metadata) about an item that enables you to create aspect histograms. A histogram enables users to drill down in each refinement narrowing the search results. You can return: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS - Lets shoppers refine the result set by variation aspects, such as Brand, Color, etc. BUYING_OPTION_REFINEMENT - Lets shoppers refine the result set by either FIXED_PRICE or AUCTION CATEGORY_REFINEMENTS - Lets shoppers refine the result set by items in a category CONDITION_REFINEMENT - Lets shoppers refine the result set by item condition, such as NEW, USED, etc. MATCHING_ITEMS - The default, which returns the items. When used with one or more of the refinement values above the specified refinements and all the matching items are returned. FULL - This returns all the refinement containers and all the matching items. Filtering by aspects You can use the ASPECT_REFINEMENTS returned to filter the result set using the aspect_filter field. For example: This call gets a list of the aspects pairs for the item and the dominant category (category most of the items are in). /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=world cup soccer ball\u0026amp;fieldgroups=ASPECT_REFINEMENTS This call filters the items by one of the aspect pairs returned and the dominant category. The category ID is required twice when using aspect_filter; once as a URI parameter and as part of the aspect_filter. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=world cup soccer ball\u0026amp;category_ids=20863\u0026amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:20863,Brand:{adidas} This call filters the items by multiple aspects /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=world cup soccer ball\u0026amp;category_ids=20863\u0026amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:20863,Brand:{adidas},Featured Refinements:{Adidas Match Ball} This call filters the items by multiple aspect values /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=world cup soccer ball\u0026amp;category_ids=20863\u0026amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:20863,Brand:{Nike|Wilson} Fields filters There are also field filters you can use to refine the result set, such as listing format, item condition, price range, listing end date, location, and more. You can use multiple field filters in a single call. For a list and details of the supported filters, see search Call Field Filters. Pagination and sort controls There are pagination controls ( limit and offset fields) and sort query parameter that control/sort the data that is returned. By default, the results are sorted by \u0026quot;Best Match\u0026quot;. For more information about Best Match, see the eBay help page Best Match. Request headers You will want to use the X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header with this call. If you are an eBay Network Partner you must use affiliateCampaignId=ePNCampaignId,affiliateReferenceId=referenceId in the header in order to be paid for selling eBay items on your site and it is strongly recommended you use contextualLocation to improve the estimated delivery window information. For details see, Request headers in the Buy APIs Overview. Restrictions This call can return a maximum of 10,000 items. For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, see API Restrictions. URL Encoding Parameters and Headers As with all query parameter values, the fields parameter value and request header values must be URL encoded. For better readability, the examples in this document omit the encoding.

This means you will need to know when something, such as the availability, quantity, etc., has changed in any eBay item you are offering. You can do this easily by setting the fieldgroups URI parameter. This parameter lets you control what is returned in the response. Setting fieldgroups to COMPACT reduces the response to only the five fields that you need in order to check if any item detail has changed. Setting fieldgroups to PRODUCT, adds additional fields to the default response that return information about the product of the item. You can use either COMPACT or PRODUCT but not both. For more information, see fieldgroups. Request headers You will want to use the X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header with this call.

If you do not set this field, the call returns all the details of the item. Valid values: PRODUCT - This adds the additionalImages, additionalProductIdentities, aspectGroups, description, gtins, image, and title product fields to the response, which describe the product associated with the item. See Product for more information about these fields. COMPACT - This returns only the following fields, which let you quickly check if the availability or price of the item has changed, if the item has been revised by the seller, or if an item's top-rated plus status has changed for items you have stored. itemId - The identifier of the item. sellerItemRevision - An identifier generated/incremented when a seller revises the item. There are two types of item revisions; seller changes, such as changing the title, and eBay system changes, such as changing the quantity when an item is purchased. This ID is changed only when the seller makes a change to the item. This means you cannot use this value to determine if the quantity has changed. topRatedBuyingExperience - A boolean value indicating if this item is a top-rated plus item. A change in the item's top rated plus standing is not tracked by the revision ID. See topRatedBuyingExperience for more information. price - This is tracked by the revision ID but is returned here to enable you to quickly verify the price of the item. estimatedAvailabilities - Returns the item availability information, which is based on the item's quantity. Changes in quantity are not tracked by the revision ID. For Example To check if a stored item's information is current, do following. Pass in the item ID and set fieldgroups to COMPACT. item/v1|46566502948|0?fieldgroups=COMPACT Do one of the following: If the sellerItemRevision field is returned and you haven't stored a revision number for this item, record the number and pass in the item ID in the getItem call to get the latest information. If the revision number is different from the value you have stored, update the value and pass in the item ID in the getItem call to get the latest information.
