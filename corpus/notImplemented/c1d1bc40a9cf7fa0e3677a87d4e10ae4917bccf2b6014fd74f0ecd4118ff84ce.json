A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { \\\"bindings\\\": [ { \\\"role\\\": \\\"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\\\", \\\"members\\\": [ \\\"user:mike@example.com\\\", \\\"group:admins@example.com\\\", \\\"domain:google.com\\\", \\\"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\\\" ] }, { \\\"role\\\": \\\"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\\\", \\\"members\\\": [ \\\"user:eve@example.com\\\" ], \\\"condition\\\": { \\\"title\\\": \\\"expirable access\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\\\", \\\"expression\\\": \\\"request.time \u003c timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\\\", } } ], \\\"etag\\\": \\\"BwWWja0YfJA=\\\", \\\"version\\\": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time \u003c timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).\"\n      properties:\n        auditConfigs:\n          description: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.\n          items:\n            $ref: \"#/components/schemas/AuditConfig\"\n          type: array\n        bindings:\n          description: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.

For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.\n          items:\n            $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Binding\"\n          type: array\n        etag:\n          description: \"`etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
