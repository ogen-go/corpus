Unify API accounts have sandbox mode and live mode API keys. To change modes just use the appropriate key to get a live or test object. You can find your API keys on the unify settings of your Apideck app. Your Apideck application_id can also be found on the same page.\n\n    Authenticate your API requests by including your test or live secret API key in the request header.\n\n    - Bearer authorization header: Authorization: Bearer \u003cyour-apideck-api-key\u003e\n    - Application id header: x-apideck-app-id: \u003cyour-apideck-app-id\u003e\n      You should use the public keys on the SDKs and the secret keys to authenticate API requests.\n\n    **Do not share or include your secret API keys on client side code.** Your API keys carry significant privileges. Please ensure to keep them 100% secure and be sure to not share your secret API keys in areas that are publicly accessible like GitHub.\n\n    Learn how to set the Authorization header inside Postman https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/sending-api-requests/authorization/#api-key\n\n    Go to Unify to grab your API KEY https://app.apideck.com/unify/api-keys\n\n    | Security Scheme Type      | HTTP   |\n    | ------------------------- | ------ |\n    | HTTP Authorization Scheme | bearer |\n\n    ### applicationId\n\n    The ID of your Unify application\n\n    | Security Scheme Type  | API Key          |\n    | --------------------- | ---------------- |\n    | Header parameter name | x-apideck-app-id |\n\n    ## Static IP\n\n    Some of the APIs you want to use can require a static IP. Apideck's static IP feature allows you to the Proxy API with a fixed IP avoiding the need for you to set up your own infrastructure. This feature is currently available to all Apideck customers.\n    To use this feature, the API Vendor will need to whitelist the associated static IP addresses.\n    The provided static IP addresses are fixed to their specified region and shared by all customers who use this feature.\n\n    - EU Central 1: **18.197.244.247**\n    - Other: upcoming\n\n      More info about our data security can be found at [https://compliance.apideck.com/](https://compliance.apideck.com/)\n\n    ## Limitations\n\n    ### Timeout\n\n    The request timeout is set at 30 seconds.\n\n    ### Response Size\n\n    The Proxy API has no response size limit. For responses larger than 2MB, the Proxy API will redirect to a temporary URL. In this case the usual Apideck response headers will be returned in the redirect response. Most HTTP clients will handle this redirect automatically.\n\n    ```\n    GET /proxy\n    \u003c 301 Moved Permanently\n    \u003c x-apideck-request-id: {{requestId}}\n    \u003c Location: {{temporaryUrl}}\n\n    GET {{temporaryUrl}}\n    \u003c {{responseBody}}\n    ```\n\n    ## SDKs and API Clients\n\n    Upcoming. [Request the SDK of your choice](https://integrations.apideck.com/request).\n\n    ## Errors\n\n    The API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n    | Code | Title                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n    | ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n    | 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response.

The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n    #### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\n    Filters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n    #### InvalidCursorError\n\n    Pagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n    #### ConnectorExecutionError\n\n    A Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n    #### UnauthorizedError\n\n    We were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n    #### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\n    A request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n    #### ConnectorDisabledError\n\n    A request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n    #### RequestLimitError\n\n    You have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.\n\n    #### EntityNotFoundError\n\n    You've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n    #### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\n    When adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n    #### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\n    The requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n    #### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\n    A valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n    #### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\n    A request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n    #### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\n    A request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n    #### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\n    The state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n    #### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\n    When attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n    #### OAuthConnectorError\n\n    It seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n    #### MappingError\n\n    There was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n    #### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\n    It seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n    #### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError\n\n    We were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n    #### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError\n\n    Connector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n    #### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\n    The composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n    #### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\n    Pagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n    ## API Design\n\n    ### API Styles and data formats\n\n    #### REST API\n\n    The API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n    ### Request IDs\n\n    Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n    ## Support\n\n    If you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n  license:\n    name: Apache 2.0\n    url: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html\n  title: Proxy API\n  version: 8.32.6\n  x-apideck-api: proxy\n  x-apisguru-categories:\n    - developer_tools\n  x-logo:\n    url: https://developers.apideck.com/icon.png\n  x-origin:\n    - format: openapi\n      url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apideck-libraries/openapi-specs/master/proxy.yml\n      version: \"3.0\"\n  x-providerName: apideck.com\n  x-serviceName: proxy\n  x-tags:\n    - partner\nexternalDocs:\n  description: Apideck Developer Docs\n  url: https://developers.apideck.com\nsecurity:\n  - apiKey: []\n    applicationId: []\ntags:\n  - description: \"\"\n    name: Execute\npaths:\n  /proxy:\n    delete:\n      description: |\n        Proxies a downstream DELETE request to a service and injects the necessary credentials into a request stored in Vault.
