Example:\n\n\n        package google.profile; message Person { string first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; }\n\n\n        { \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\", \"firstName\": , \"lastName\":  }\n\n\n        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type` field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):\n\n\n        { \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\", \"value\": \"1.212s\" }\n      properties:\n        typeUrl:\n          description: \u003e-\n            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the\n            serialized protocol buffer message. This string must contain at\n            least one \"/\" character. The last segment of the URL's path must\n            represent the fully qualified name of the type (as in\n            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical\n            form (e.g., leading \".\" is not accepted).\n\n\n            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:\n\n\n            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][] value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage breaking changes.)\n\n\n            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with type.googleapis.com.\n\n\n            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be used with implementation specific semantics.\n          type: string\n        value:\n          description: Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above specified\n            type.\n          format: byte\n          type: string\n      type: object\n    AppStartTime:\n      properties:\n        fullyDrawnTime:\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Duration\"\n        initialDisplayTime:\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Duration\"\n      type: object\n    BasicPerfSampleSeries:\n      description: Encapsulates the metadata for basic sample series represented by a line\n        chart\n      properties:\n        perfMetricType:\n          enum:\n            - cpu\n            - graphics\n            - memory\n            - network\n            - perfMetricTypeUnspecified\n          type: string\n        perfUnit:\n          enum:\n            - byte\n            - bytesPerSecond\n            - framesPerSecond\n            - kibibyte\n            - percent\n            - perfUnitUnspecified\n          type: string\n        sampleSeriesLabel:\n          enum:\n            - cpuKernel\n            - cpuTotal\n            - cpuUser\n            - graphicsFrameRate\n            - memoryRssPrivate\n            - memoryRssShared\n            - memoryRssTotal\n            - memoryTotal\n            - networkReceived\n            - networkSent\n            - ntBytesReceived\n            - ntBytesTransferred\n            - sampleSeriesTypeUnspecified\n          type: string\n      type: object\n    BatchCreatePerfSamplesRequest:\n      description: The request must provide up to a maximum of 5000 samples to be created;\n        a larger sample size will cause an INVALID_ARGUMENT error\n      properties:\n        perfSamples:\n          description: The set of PerfSamples to create should not include existing\n            timestamps\n          items:\n            $ref: \"#/components/schemas/PerfSample\"\n          type: array\n      type: object\n    BatchCreatePerfSamplesResponse:\n      properties:\n        perfSamples:\n          items:\n            $ref: \"#/components/schemas/PerfSample\"\n          type: array\n      type: object\n    CPUInfo:\n      properties:\n        cpuProcessor:\n          description: description of the device processor ie '1.8 GHz hexa core 64-bit\n            ARMv8-A'\n          type: string\n        cpuSpeedInGhz:\n          description: the CPU clock speed in GHz\n          format: float\n          type: number\n        numberOfCores:\n          description: the number of CPU cores\n          format: int32\n          type: integer\n      type: object\n    Duration:\n      description: \u003e-\n        A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented as\n        a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond resolution. It\n        is independent of any calendar and concepts like \"day\" or \"month\". It is\n        related to Timestamp in that the difference between two Timestamp values\n        is a Duration and it can be added or subtracted from a Timestamp. Range\n        is approximately +-10,000 years.\n\n\n        # Examples\n\n\n        Example 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.\n\n\n        Timestamp start = ...; Timestamp end = ...; Duration duration = ...;\n\n\n        duration.seconds = end.seconds - start.seconds; duration.nanos = end.nanos - start.nanos;\n\n\n        if (duration.seconds  0) { duration.seconds += 1; duration.nanos -= 1000000000; } else if (duration.seconds \u003e 0 \u0026\u0026 duration.nanos \u003c 0) { duration.seconds -= 1; duration.nanos += 1000000000; }\n\n\n        Example 2: Compute Timestamp from Timestamp + Duration in pseudo code.\n\n\n        Timestamp start = ...; Duration duration = ...; Timestamp end = ...;\n\n\n        end.seconds = start.seconds + duration.seconds; end.nanos = start.nanos + duration.nanos;\n\n\n        if (end.nanos = 1000000000) { end.seconds += 1; end.nanos -= 1000000000; }\n\n\n        Example 3: Compute Duration from datetime.timedelta in Python.\n\n\n        td = datetime.timedelta(days=3, minutes=10) duration = Duration() duration.FromTimedelta(td)\n\n\n        # JSON Mapping\n\n\n        In JSON format, the Duration type is encoded as a string rather than an object, where the string ends in the suffix \"s\" (indicating seconds) and is preceded by the number of seconds, with nanoseconds expressed as fractional seconds. For example, 3 seconds with 0 nanoseconds should be encoded in JSON format as \"3s\", while 3 seconds and 1 nanosecond should be expressed in JSON format as \"3.000000001s\", and 3 seconds and 1 microsecond should be expressed in JSON format as \"3.000001s\".\n      properties:\n        nanos:\n          description: Signed fractions of a second at nanosecond resolution of the span of\n            time.

The workflow would look like: - user creates a Execution with id 1 - user creates an TestExecutionStep with id 100 for Execution 1 - user update TestExecutionStep with id 100 to add a raw xml log + the service parses the xml logs and returns a TestExecutionStep with updated TestResult(s). - user update the status of TestExecutionStep with id 100 to COMPLETE\n\n\n        A Step can be updated until its state is set to COMPLETE at which points it becomes immutable.\n\n\n        Next tag: 27\n      properties:\n        completionTime:\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Timestamp\"\n        creationTime:\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Timestamp\"\n        description:\n          description: \u003e-\n            A description of this tool For example: mvn clean package -D\n            skipTests=true\n\n\n            - In response: present if set by create/update request - In create/update request: optional\n          type: string\n        deviceUsageDuration:\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/Duration\"\n        dimensionValue:\n          description: \u003e-\n            If the execution containing this step has any dimension_definition\n            set, then this field allows the child to specify the values of the\n            dimensions.\n\n\n            The keys must exactly match the dimension_definition of the execution.\n\n\n            For example, if the execution has `dimension_definition = ['attempt', 'device']` then a step must define values for those dimensions, eg. `dimension_value = ['attempt': '1', 'device': 'Nexus 6']`\n\n\n            If a step does not participate in one dimension of the matrix, the value for that dimension should be empty string. For example, if one of the tests is executed by a runner which does not support retries, the step could have `dimension_value = ['attempt': '', 'device': 'Nexus 6']`\n\n\n            If the step does not participate in any dimensions of the matrix, it may leave dimension_value unset.\n\n\n            A PRECONDITION_FAILED will be returned if any of the keys do not exist in the dimension_definition of the execution.\n\n\n            A PRECONDITION_FAILED will be returned if another step in this execution already has the same name and dimension_value, but differs on other data fields, for example, step field is different.\n\n\n            A PRECONDITION_FAILED will be returned if dimension_value is set, and there is a dimension_definition in the execution which is not specified as one of the keys.\n\n\n            - In response: present if set by create - In create request: optional - In update request: never set\n          items:\n            $ref: \"#/components/schemas/StepDimensionValueEntry\"\n          type: array\n        hasImages:\n          description: \u003e-\n            Whether any of the outputs of this step are images whose thumbnails\n            can be fetched with ListThumbnails.\n\n\n            - In response: always set - In create/update request: never set\n          type: boolean\n        labels:\n          description: \u003e-\n            Arbitrary user-supplied key/value pairs that are associated with the\n            step.\n\n\n            Users are responsible for managing the key namespace such that keys don't accidentally collide.\n\n\n            An INVALID_ARGUMENT will be returned if the number of labels exceeds 100 or if the length of any of the keys or values exceeds 100 characters.\n\n\n            - In response: always set - In create request: optional - In update request: optional; any new key/value pair will be added to the map, and any new value for an existing key will update that key's value\n          items:\n            $ref: \"#/components/schemas/StepLabelsEntry\"\n          type: array\n        multiStep:\n          $ref: \"#/components/schemas/MultiStep\"\n        name:\n          description: \u003e-\n            A short human-readable name to display in the UI.

The count is relative to an epoch at UTC\n        midnight on January 1, 1970, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar which\n        extends the Gregorian calendar backwards to year one.\n\n\n        All minutes are 60 seconds long. Leap seconds are \"smeared\" so that no leap second table is needed for interpretation, using a [24-hour linear smear](https://developers.google.com/time/smear).\n\n\n        The range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. By restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to and from [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) date strings.\n\n\n        # Examples\n\n\n        Example 1: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `time()`.\n\n\n        Timestamp timestamp; timestamp.set_seconds(time(NULL)); timestamp.set_nanos(0);\n\n\n        Example 2: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `gettimeofday()`.\n\n\n        struct timeval tv; gettimeofday(\u0026tv, NULL);\n\n\n        Timestamp timestamp; timestamp.set_seconds(tv.tv_sec); timestamp.set_nanos(tv.tv_usec * 1000);\n\n\n        Example 3: Compute Timestamp from Win32 `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()`.\n\n\n        FILETIME ft; GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(\u0026ft); UINT64 ticks = (((UINT64)ft.dwHighDateTime) \u003c\u003c 32) | ft.dwLowDateTime;\n\n\n        // A Windows tick is 100 nanoseconds. Windows epoch 1601-01-01T00:00:00Z // is 11644473600 seconds before Unix epoch 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. Timestamp timestamp; timestamp.set_seconds((INT64) ((ticks / 10000000) - 11644473600LL)); timestamp.set_nanos((INT32) ((ticks % 10000000) * 100));\n\n\n        Example 4: Compute Timestamp from Java `System.currentTimeMillis()`.\n\n\n        long millis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n\n\n        Timestamp timestamp = Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(millis / 1000) .setNanos((int) ((millis % 1000) * 1000000)).build();\n\n\n\n\n        Example 5: Compute Timestamp from current time in Python.\n\n\n        timestamp = Timestamp() timestamp.GetCurrentTime()\n\n\n        # JSON Mapping\n\n\n        In JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format. That is, the format is \"{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z\" where {year} is always expressed using four digits while {month}, {day}, {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution), are optional. The \"Z\" suffix indicates the timezone (\"UTC\"); the timezone is required. A proto3 JSON serializer should always use UTC (as indicated by \"Z\") when printing the Timestamp type and a proto3 JSON parser should be able to accept both UTC and other timezones (as indicated by an offset).\n\n\n        For example, \"2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z\" encodes 15.01 seconds past 01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017.\n\n\n        In JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the standard [toISOString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString) method. In Python, a standard `datetime.datetime` object can be converted to this format using [`strftime`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime) with the time format spec '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'. Likewise, in Java, one can use the Joda Time's [`ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime()`]( http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/ISODateTimeFormat.html#dateTime%2D%2D ) to obtain a formatter capable of generating timestamps in this format.\n      properties:\n        nanos:\n          description: Non-negative fractions of a second at nanosecond resolution.\n            Negative second values with fractions must still have non-negative\n            nanos values that count forward in time.
