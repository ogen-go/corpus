This system evaluates the asset class, economic development level, and geographical region as described in each fund's prospectus and marketing materials. Fund exposure details are presented on successively granular levels- category, then focus, and then niche. Moreover, FactSet Fund Reference captures over 40 unique data points for U.S. mutual funds. All data items are grouped in one of two levels, either as a Fund or as a Share Class.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor more details regarding FactSet's Fund Classification, visit Online Assistant [21436](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/21436) or download - [FactSet Fund Classification System Rules \u0026 Methodology](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/cms/oaAttachment/4547a2f4-5df5-4ec9-a0d3-7d51610dd637/26837)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n        |Classification Type|Description|\n        |---|---|\n        |Asset Class|The asset class of the fund (e.g. Equity, Fixed Income, Currency, Commodities, Asset Allocation, or Alternatives) based on the fund’s mandate.|\n        |Category|The 1st of 3 asset-class-specific, hierarchical exposure tiers; the broadest category the fund falls under within its asset class (e.g., Size \u0026 Style, Sector, Precious Metals, Absolute Returns); based on the fund’s mandate.|\n        |Focus|The 2nd of 3 asset-class-specific, hierarchical exposure tiers; the fund's classification within its category (e.g. Small Cap, Energy, Palladium, Long/Short); based on the fund’s mandate.|\n        |Niche|The 3rd of 3 asset-class-specific, hierarchical exposure tiers; The fund's classification within its Focus.
