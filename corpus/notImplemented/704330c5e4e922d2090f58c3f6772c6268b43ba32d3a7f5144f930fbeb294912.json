The 'not' property negates the operator such that not and == means\n            'not equal to' (or 'not in' for a list), and not \u003e means \u003c=, and not \u003c\n            means \u003e=, and not matches means does not match.

If 'value' is of data type 'object',\n            the keys of the object MAY be treated as a list. A 'list' data type paired\n            with the '\u003e' or '\u003c' operators will encode extraneous comparisons, but\n            this is permitted as it is in SQL and other languages.\n          example: 57.0\n          title: value\n        unit_id:\n          description: CURIE of the units of the value or list of values in the 'value'\n            property.
