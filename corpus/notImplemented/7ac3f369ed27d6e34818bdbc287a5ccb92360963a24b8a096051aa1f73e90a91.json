For example, the release name may include the environment name, application name, application version, or any other name meaningful to the developer. Once a `Release` refers to a `Ruleset`, the rules can be enforced by Firebase Rules-enabled services. More than one `Release` may be 'live' concurrently. Consider the following three `Release` names for `projects/foo` and the `Ruleset` to which they refer. Release Name -\u003e Ruleset Name * projects/foo/releases/prod -\u003e projects/foo/rulesets/uuid123 * projects/foo/releases/prod/beta -\u003e projects/foo/rulesets/uuid123 * projects/foo/releases/prod/v23 -\u003e projects/foo/rulesets/uuid456 The relationships reflect a `Ruleset` rollout in progress. The `prod` and `prod/beta` releases refer to the same `Ruleset`. However, `prod/v23` refers to a new `Ruleset`.
