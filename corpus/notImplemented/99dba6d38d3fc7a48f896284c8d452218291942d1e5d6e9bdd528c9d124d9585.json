Note: The 'Manufacturer Refurbished' item condition is no longer a valid item condition in any eBay marketplace, and to reflect this change, the pre-existing MANUFACTURER_REFURBISHED enumeration value has been replaced by the CERTIFIED_REFURBISHED enumeration value.

To list an item as 'Certified Refurbished', a seller must be pre-qualified by eBay for this feature. Any seller who is not eligible for this feature will be blocked if they try to create a new listing or revise an existing listing with this item condition. Any seller that is interested in eligibility requirements to list with 'Certified Refurbished' should see the Certified refurbished program page in Seller Center.
