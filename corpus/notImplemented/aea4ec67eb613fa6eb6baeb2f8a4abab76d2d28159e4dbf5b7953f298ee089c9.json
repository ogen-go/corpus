When it becomes ready, developers switch on the staging branch using this API while keeping using `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` as SearchRequest.branch to route the traffic to this staging branch.

NOTE: the `name` binding allows API services to override the binding to use different resource name schemes, such as `users/*/operations`. To override the binding, API services can add a binding such as `\\\"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations\\\"` to their service configuration. For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.\"\n      operationId: retail.projects.operations.list\n      parameters:\n        - description: The name of the operation's parent resource.\n          in: path\n          name: name\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: The standard list filter.\n          in: query\n          name: filter\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: The standard list page size.\n          in: query\n          name: pageSize\n          schema:\n            type: integer\n        - description: The standard list page token.\n          in: query\n          name: pageToken\n          schema:\n            type: string\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/GoogleLongrunningListOperationsResponse\"\n          description: Successful response\n      security:\n        - Oauth2:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n          Oauth2c:\n            - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\n      tags:\n        - projects\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/_.xgafv\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/access_token\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/alt\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/callback\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/fields\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/key\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/oauth_token\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/prettyPrint\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/quotaUser\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/upload_protocol\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/uploadType\"\n  \"/v2alpha/{name}:setInventory\":\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/_.xgafv\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/access_token\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/alt\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/callback\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/fields\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/key\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/oauth_token\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/prettyPrint\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/quotaUser\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/upload_protocol\"\n      - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/uploadType\"\n    post:\n      description: Updates inventory information for a Product while respecting the last update timestamps of each inventory field. This process is asynchronous and does not require the Product to exist before updating fulfillment information. If the request is valid, the update will be enqueued and processed downstream. As a consequence, when a response is returned, updates are not immediately manifested in the Product queried by GetProduct or ListProducts. When inventory is updated with CreateProduct and UpdateProduct, the specified inventory field value(s) will overwrite any existing value(s) while ignoring the last update time for this field. Furthermore, the last update time for the specified inventory fields will be overwritten to the time of the CreateProduct or UpdateProduct request. If no inventory fields are set in CreateProductRequest.product, then any pre-existing inventory information for this product will be used. If no inventory fields are set in SetInventoryRequest.set_mask, then any existing inventory information will be preserved. Pre-existing inventory information can only be updated with SetInventory, ProductService.AddFulfillmentPlaces, and RemoveFulfillmentPlaces.
