This makes it possible to copy a channel between projects\n        without requiring manual reverification of the channel. If the channel\n        is not in the verified state, this method will fail (in other words,\n        this may only be used if the SendNotificationChannelVerificationCode and\n        VerifyNotificationChannel paths have already been used to put the given\n        channel into the verified state).There is no guarantee that the\n        verification codes returned by this method will be of a similar\n        structure or form as the ones that are delivered to the channel via\n        SendNotificationChannelVerificationCode; while\n        VerifyNotificationChannel() will recognize both the codes delivered via\n        SendNotificationChannelVerificationCode() and returned from\n        GetNotificationChannelVerificationCode(), it is typically the case that\n        the verification codes delivered via\n        SendNotificationChannelVerificationCode() will be shorter and also have\n        a shorter expiration (e.g. codes such as \"G-123456\") whereas\n        GetVerificationCode() will typically return a much longer, websafe base\n        64 encoded string that has a longer expiration time.\n      operationId: monitoring.projects.notificationChannels.getVerificationCode\n      parameters:\n        - description: The notification channel for which a verification code is to be\n            generated and retrieved.

Each\n        group has a filter that is matched against monitored resources and their\n        associated metadata. If a group's filter matches an available monitored\n        resource, then that resource is a member of that group. Groups can\n        contain any number of monitored resources, and each monitored resource\n        can be a member of any number of groups.Groups can be nested in\n        parent-child hierarchies. The parentName field identifies an optional\n        parent for each group.

A group without a parent can contain any\n        monitored resource.For example, consider an infrastructure running a set\n        of instances with two user-defined tags: \\\"environment\\\" and \\\"role\\\".
