If no country code is specified, the call returns all shipping rate tables that have been assigned a rateTableId (to assign an ID to an older rate table, call this method using the table's country code). The method's response includes a rateTableId for each table defined by the seller. Use a table's ID value in a fulfillment policy to specify the shipping rate table to use for that policy's DOMESTIC or INTERNATIONAL shipping option (make sure the locality of the rate table matches the optionType of the shipping option). Sellers can define up to 40 shipping rate tables for their account, which lets them set up different rate tables for each of the marketplaces they sell into. Go to My eBay \u0026gt; Account \u0026gt; Site Preferences to create and maintain the rate tables. For more, see Using shipping rate tables. If you're using the Trading API, use the rate table ID values in the RateTableDetails container of the Add/Revise/Relist calls. If the locality for a rate table is set to DOMESTIC, pass the ID value in the RateTableDetails.DomesticRateTableId field. Otherwise, if locality is INTERNATIONAL, pass the ID value in RateTableDetails.InternationalRateTableId. Note: For regions that are not yet ramped up with multi-rate table support, this method returns an ID that maps to the seller's default rate table for the country specified.

To see if the feature is enabled in any given year, check the Returns on eBay page before the holiday season begins. If the feature is not enabled for the season, this field is ignored.

Sellers can specify Extended Holiday Returns (as well as their regular non-holiday returns period) for chosen listings at any time during the year. The Extended Holiday Returns offer is not visible in listings until the start date of current year's holiday returns period, at which point it overrides the non-holiday returns policy. Buyers can see the Extended Holiday Returns offer in listings displayed through the purchase cutoff date and are able to return those purchases until the end date of the period. After the purchase cutoff date, the Extended Holiday Returns offer automatically disappears from the listings and the seller's non-holiday returns period reappears.
