The compatible vehicle property\n            name and corresponding value are delimited with a colon (:), such as\n            filter=Year:2018, and multiple compatible vehicle property\n            name/value pairs are delimited with a comma (,). For example, if you\n            wanted to retrieve all vehicle trims for a 2018 Toyota Camry, you\n            would set the compatibility_property filter as follows:\n            compatibility_property=Trim; and then include the following three\n            name/value filters through one filter parameter:\n            filter=Year:2018,Make:Toyota,Model:Camry.
